	<string id="dolg_heavy_outfit_description">
		<text>This early model of the Duty bodysuit is the Spetsnaz PSZ-9 body armour modified for the Zone. The suit is capable of stopping a rifle bullet, however, this level of protection comes at the cost of its weight, bulkiness and virtually non-existent anomaly protection. The suit cannot be modified with an artefact container, but may be upgraded with a combat support system.</text>

	<string id="svoboda_heavy_outfit_description">
		<text>This stalker bodysuit with reinforced body armour made by Freedom craftsmen represents a good compromise between combat and anomaly protection. The built-in body armour comprises armour plating and ten Kevlar layers, capable of stopping a pistol bullet. The suit uses the relatively expensive Sovereign compound for anomaly protection. Comes with an artefact container.</text>

    		<text>An upgraded version of a regular exoskeleton. The use of lighter materials allowed the designers to reduce the suit's weight and with Freedom's usual trademark of high quality anomaly protection the only thing that suffers is its overall armour and impact.

		<text>Leather jacket</text>
	</string>

	<string id="novice_outfit_description">
		<text>The leather jacket does not provide sufficient protection from the Zone's harsh conditions, since it's simply a leather anorak with blue trousers tucked into hiking boots. Typically, it's also worn with a backpack with extra straps across the chest. Leather offers little protection from gunfire or claws and it's absolutely useless against radiation or anomalies.</text>

	<string id="stalker_outfit_description">
		<text>This DIY stalker bodysuit is a combination of a bodysuit of twin-layered rubberized cloth with Plexiglas lining and built-in body armour.

	<string id="exo_outfit_description">

Sphere M12 is normally used as part of a combination that includes PSZ series Spetsnaz body armour.

	<string id="st_helm_m40_descr">
		<text>The M40 was the result of a program in the 1980s to develop a successor to the M17-series protective masks. The M40 was to be a return to conventional gas mask design with an external side-mounted filter canister, rather than the internal cheek filters of the M17, which were awkward to change, especially in a contaminated environment. The M40 is favoured amongst westerners such as the Mercenaries, lacking strong protection vs. anomalies the M40 provide moderate bullet protection.</text>
