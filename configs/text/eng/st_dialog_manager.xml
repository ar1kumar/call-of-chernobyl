<!-- ANOMALIES -->
	<string id="dm_anomalies_general_1">
		<text>Where can I find artifacts?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_general_2">
		<text>You know anything about artifacts or anomalies?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_general_3">
		<text>What can you tell me about anomalies?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_0">
		<text>I don't feel comfortable telling you anything.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_1">
		<text>You don't always have to crawl through anomalies to find artefacts. Someone told me a story of how they found an artefact in an open field. A stalker's detector starts going crazy, so he figures it has a blown capacitor. He replaces it and it starts working; Lo and behold, an artifact practically falls into his hands. Man, what luck. The Zone is like that though: sometimes it deals out a punishment, and sometimes a gift.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_2">
		<text>Watch out for Whirligig and Vortex anomalies, man. They are absolutely dangerous, even for an experienced stalker. It will snatch you up and violently shake you around like a rag doll. One time I seen this dude get caught up in one. I thought I would be getting me a new pair of boots, but this sucker started running as fast as he could. I couldn't believe this shit, he fucking dove right outta there before he was shredded.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_3">
		<text>Ever hear of a Gravi? Looks like something a Pseudodog would shit out, but it's metallic. Scientists are willing to pay well for these things. I wouldn't bother though, anyone who touches one of those fucking things will be glowing for a month. There are similar artifacts called Goldfish, I'm sure you can guess what it looks like, it's even more rare. Better keep it to yourself if you find one, though.</text>
	</string>
   <string id="dm_anomalies_4">
	  <text>The first thing you should put your hands on is at least a Medusa. The more absorbing radiations artefact you can get, like a Wrenched or a Bubble, the safest you will be. I've already seen too much stalkers slowly dying of radiations, without been able to reach a medic or even too poor to buy some antirads. \n You know how it goes here? It just need a rain or a blowout to make from a hill we could safely cross before a hell of becquerels. And like for everyone else, you'll probably be forced to run in some paths you thought you already known...</text>
   </string>   
   <string id="dm_anomalies_5">
	  <text>I can't figure out what the scientists make from the artefacts they buy from the Zone. All I know is credits for these seems to be limitless. And whatever if the thing is positive or not, the more powerful an artefact is, the more they pay.</text>
   </string>   
   <string id="dm_anomalies_6">
	  <text>Have you ever heard of the Glass ? It looks like a dirty and yet shiny glass ball. Man, this thing could stop bleeding from the worst wounds if you have something to cure its radiations. If someday you find one, don't sell it if you can.</text>
   </string>
   <string id="dm_anomalies_7">
	  <text>Every experienced stalkers I met told me that the artefact hunt would be easier at night, because of their glow which makes them more easily noticeable even with a basic detector. They are kind, but how do you go search the countryside with all the beasts that come out at night?</text>
   </string>
   <string id="dm_anomalies_8">
	  <text>I have several times heard of something called the "Compass". It would appear that this artifact would be almost perfect, apart from the radiation it emits. It was rumored that it protects against many of the risks of the Zone, but even more, it would seem that the wearer naturally find some paths through the worst anomaly fields. \n But I do not really believe this kind of myth. Anyway, I have never heard even one information on the type of anomaly where we should find it. Nor anyone having actually seen one...</text>
   </string>
   <string id="dm_anomalies_9">
      <text>What can I tell you more than the stories everybody hears here, around the fire ? \n If you want an advice, just take care about everything. All this country is not a place to be safe.</text>
   </string>
    <string id="dm_anomalies_10">
      <text>I often heard stories about some unhoped, wonderful artefacts fields that could make from a poor inexperienced stalker a rich man. \n My opinion is all these are traps. How can anyone logically thinking about getting into such anomalies mazes, just out of greed? Especially knowing that the anomalies can move and so, close an exit... \n If you think about it, the little shinny things that attract you in are perfect in their roles.</text>
   </string>
   <string id="dm_anomalies_11">
      <text>All I can say is to be really careful about the gear you choose and for which purpose. Don't expect to go for an artefact hunt with a heavy shielded exo. It can become like a pin with electric fields and will melt on you like hot chocolate in chemical ones.</text>
   </string>
    <string id="dm_anomalies_12">
      <text>The harder part with anomalies and artefacts is the starting. If you can grab some protective artefact, you can then explore other anomalies of the same type easily. Then sell your findings, get a better gear, and so on. plus, the more you cross them the more you know how to do it. \n Just be really careful. From your beginner's hours to an experienced stalker if you come to be one. The Zone always keep new traps, even for the most experienced of ours.</text>
   </string>
   <string id="dm_anomalies_13">
      <text>Be in good shape is the clever advice I can give to you. The Zone can be really harsh and exhaustive sometimes. You'll had better chances to survive to the long trips and their inevitable hazards if your body is ready for it. It's true about anomalies too. \n Do you think you can cross a chemical field with a pack of mutants at your back, after a night of vodka abuse ?</text>
   </string>
    <string id="dm_anomalies_14">
      <text>Many stalkers, even more those regularly using vodka, don't pay attention to the psychic dangers of the Zone. And so, they die when they have to get out of some brain crusher field. \n It's a good thing to find some psychic protections. The "Moonlight" artefact can make the difference on decisive times. Plus, it can be useful against a Controller, for instance.</text>
   </string>
    <string id="dm_anomalies_15">
      <text>Keep in mind that some people here don't bother to chase the artefacts. They prefer to hunt humans... \n In other words, pay a high attention to the Bandits. It's well known they have orders for artefacts for their black market. Also, do not let too many people know what artefacts you have.</text>
   </string>
   <string id="dm_anomalies_16">
      <text>Did you know that artefacts are almost indestructible ? \n Sometimes it's better to shoot at the artefact to make it jump out of the anomaly, instead of just being sucked directly into it.</text>
   </string>
   <string id="dm_anomalies_17">
      <text>I started to hear some rumors about some strange kind of trees or some bushes that acted like anomalies. \n According to the rumors, some species where reported on the old areas that became reachable again and especially in abandoned buildings. And the tale says these give their own artefacts... Stories, if you want my opinion.</text>
   </string>
   <string id="dm_anomalies_18">
      <text>I wish I had known the Zone that I've heard about, the one that was like a no man's land. \n How can we be rich now ? Now that after any blowout, a bunch of stalker rush on every anomaly field to pick up their flowers.</text>
   </string>
   <string id="dm_anomalies_19">
      <text>Why should I give you some advice ? More again when it come to the business which many of us use for making money to survive in this crap ? \n Well, get a good detector and help yourself. You will have a better chance to buy some with the scientists.</text>
   </string>
   <string id="dm_anomalies_20">
      <text>Many newcomers fantasize about "the artefact that makes you rich". Don't do this. \n Even if the Zone can be fruitful, it often take a long time and a serous amount of money to get the gear that let you go inside the most dangerous and then productive areas. Of course, you can be lucky but, knowing the place I won't count this much on that.</text>

		<text>You know what's going on around here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_general_3">

	<string id="dm_information_0">
		<text>I don't have any information.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_1">
		<text>Why are you here Stalker? Some pieces of shit are here because of curiosity or even wanting an adventure. Knifing those bastards usually makes me very happy, but most of the time I stick to the job. You see I'm here for the job, whatever that might be. I'd rape a fucking flesh if there is money coming for doing that. See I don't care, I know what I'm here for, and none of these idealistic bastards could ever say that. So think about it. But don't think too much or you might end up in a ditch filled with bodies.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_2">
		<text>I wonder what those freak "animal rights" activists would say about how we treat animals here. If you could call these hellish beasts "animals." I call them hell spawns, and then I usually shoot them in the face, because that's what you do to hell spawns, you don't shelter them, feed them or God forbid, nurture them. You slam some lead into their ugly faces and you move out of there before any other arrive.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_3">
		<text>You want excitement? Is this place to boring for you? Go say hello to a Snork or a Bloodsucker, if you go directly at them and greet them nicely, they won't even get aggressive. It's weird I had this one friend, he was a bit of a bandit, and he wanted to do just that. I haven't seen him since but it sure is worth a try don't you think? It's strange how not many people have tried this, it's bound to work, you don't even have to carry any weapons.</text>

	<string id="dm_information_4">
		<text>My grandfather fought for the country, my father died for this piece of land and I'd be damned if I let this black hole eat away my motherland. The last thing my grandfather said before he succumbed to the crippling cancer was that I need to care for my land. That is what I'm doing here, or rather, that was what I was supposed to be doing here. Things have changed now, I'm not even sure who I'm supposed to fight for. I had to put a bullet through the spine of good friend of mine. The fool didn't "believe" in emissions, so when a psyonic one hit, he was gathering flowers or some shit. Afterwards he went insane and started shooting at everything that moves. I had to take him down, The same guy that I shared food with, the same guy that saved my ass every time I fucked up. What am I supposed to tell his kids now? Fuck this place.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_5">
		<text>They say that I made a mistake coming here. They are a bunch of cowards. I'd rather be here than stuck behind some shitty desk. That's what would finish me off, not a mutated puppy, but mindless endless paperwork. Horror lives inside those gigantic stacks of papers, not under the Pripyat sewers. This is where I belong, and this place is where I can actually be myself. Camo suits me much better than any tie, and a rifle communicates with people much better than any "meetings" ever could.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_6">
		<text>Check the sky, never let your head drop. That is the exact moment when all hell will break loose, emissions would appear and mutants would chew your flesh off. Fight off any sleepiness with caffeine, food, do whatever you need to do, but keep yourself awake. I sleep for only 2 or three hours a day, and always with shooter near me. This is something that you either do, or you don't and I'd be talking to a dead carcass right now. Keep that in mind and get your shit together.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_7">
		<text>People do drugs here, it's shit and it fucks them up bad, but to survive, you do whatever you can. If that means doing coke probably cut with detergent, then it's coke and detergent all the way. I've seen some shit for brains that can't taste the awful food unless they are high on some crap. I'd wager if they don't get their daily fix, they would rather starve to death than eat food that usually smells of dog piss, and most probably is exactly that. Junkies don't live long enough here. If you get addicted, the first thing you start doing is thieving, later you join the bandits, but soon enough you start thieving from them, and that's when your life story ends and you get cut up like a pig, or thrown into a Snork hole. Don't fuck with bandits, and don't fuck with drugs "too much."</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_8">
		<text>Have you ever heard about the Monolith and its fanatics? I still clearly recall the day when the news came out that a group of stalkers was moving towards the North, all joined in some mysterious faith that perplexed everyone who spread the news about it across the entire Zone. Now they've become vehement opponents who believe that they cannot stray from the true path; they are well armed and their prolonged exposure to the harsh environment and their brainwashing have made them to be almost completely unfeeling warriors. I also fear that their armament is partially our own faction's fault when it comes to their Gauss rifles as the EM1 prototype was lost right at the NPP during Clear Sky's leadership's devastating defeat.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_9">
		<text>Does the name Scar ring any bells for you? He was the one who was able to repent the hordes of Renegade fighters and mutants alike, he helped us survive and thrive for a short amount of time, and I'm saying "for a short amount of time" because he was also the cause of our downfall. Lebedev and his assembled group fought their way up to the power plant itself, but they perished when another Great Emission occurred right after Scar managed to severely injure Strelok. Then again, I always had the feeling that Lebedev was using Scar as a valuable asset thanks to his fighting prowess, so his rush towards the Zone's source and the crumble of Clear Sky was his fault as well.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_10">
		<text>The mercenaries have always remained secretive of their operations, and I partially feel glad about that. We haven't had a lot of run-ins before and some even provided help before our leadership fell apart. They tend to keep their distance and as long as you don't poke your nose around you'll be fine. However, if you feel like being a daredevil, you can trudge past the Swamps, Agroprom and Yantar and wind up in Dead City. There are rumours going around that the mercs have established a small base of operations there, which means the possibility of accruing loot and obtaining a special spot on their hit list.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_11">
		<text>It's tough for a wandering loner when he's been caught by a military patrol. If you're caught by bandits you can at least spare your belongings and make it away with your heart still in your chest, or get thrown into a mutant nest in the worst case, but the soldiers... Things have always been on a razor edge with the grunts ever since the days when we loners could be counted as a faction on its own, even though we felt better to not be constituted as such. Then a quarrel occurred all thanks to some bastard who was affiliated with the military and was worth more than the dirt beneath my boots. That was when things went downhill and the soldiers began to punish us sevenfold for our actions. We'll never be able to go back to those days of shady deals between each side now.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_12">
		<text>Are you going to the Red Forest, stalker, or still planning to do so? If so, stay the hell away from the forested part of it. Don't set your foot upon the soil there unless you either have a death wish or enough equipment to wage a war across the entire Zone. There are enough mutants to make even the gloomiest laboratory jealous and enough Monolithian and military patrols to keep you on the edge every passing second. But hey, if you manage to clear the place out I'll be grateful to you and maybe I'll put in a word for you amongst a few friends of mine before we head out on an expedition of our own.</text>

	<string id="dm_information_13">
		<text>Do you want your armor to get repaired? Are you looking for a place where you can get that fancy gun of yours outfitted with enough parts to turn it into a death machine? Or maybe you just long for the company of a man who is never sober and is a good drinking buddy as long as he's able to keep his eyelids from shutting the light of the world away from him? If so, then Cardan's the guy who you're looking for. Right now he's staying at the 100 Rads and it doesn't look like he's going to move an inch away from the spot, so head there if you need his assistance.</text>

		<text>There was this one guy who kept irritating me and my guys. So one day we decided that we had had enough of his mug and our tough hitter, Lyoha, pounced on him and smashed his face in the ground. Then we tied our little precious sucker up, right after silencing him with a piece of cloth, and brought him to a large crack in the ground that leads to an anomalous lake underneath it. That's when he "accidentally" fell down through the crack. Then after barely a week had passed we were walking past the same spot and guess who we saw? It was the same lil' loudmouth who we had thrown down into the darkness. He was on the ground and was squirming like a beached fish. He didn't respond to our yelling but as soon as a man from my squad went close to him and turned the sucker's face towards his to look at it, he froze for a second and saw that our poor victim's eyes were as white as a loner pissing his pants in fear from seeing a bloodsucker right in front of him. So, we couldn't just leave him there to flap around like a retard after we'd leave so I ordered one of my guys, a real joker, to finish him off. He took out his knife and sniggered to himself because the guy looked like a fish like I mentioned a while ago. So he slit his belly open and the next thing I know is that he's burying his face in the mud from intense pain. Then something pops out and starts to roll around, we couldn't see the thing itself but we could see how the grass kept being pressed to the ground wherever the thing moved. And what do you know, it turned out that the poor lil' sucker had an artifact in his belly! Our "fish cleaner" turned into a nice object to joke about that.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_15">
		<text>I suggest you stay away from people who act odd. Like, real weird. You see, one night me and a whole group was resting among shacks which were located near a forest. There's this one guy who got really drunk from all the vodka we had stolen the day prior to that. He stood up and walked into the darkness and disappeared for half an hour or so. We obviously didn't give a shit about him then and kept joking and having our own share of fun. Then he stumbles back in and says how he met a fat guy who told him to bring his slender friend over to party with us. We laughed it off and told him to sit back down and finally just drink himself to sleep. After a while the fire got weaker and some of us went to sleep. So I'm sitting right next to the drunkard who's still mumbling something, when I feel someone's hand rest on my shoulder. I tell him to fuck off, you know, manners come first and you have to respect one's share of personal space, except that the hand does not move. I look back and see a man in tattered clothes, his face uglier than a lousy street rat you'd meet in the Big Land. Then the next feature of his body struck me unexpected - unusually long God damn hands. And he's standing there, one hand resting on my shoulder and the other on the ground while he's staring at me. The others hadn't even noticed him and didn't pay attention, I felt like I was just seeing shit and the others who were still up cared only about themselves and were thinking what to do the next day. The drunkard stands up and gets real close to the ugly shit, like, real close, and mumbles a few words. "This is... the friend I told you about." A slender guy, right, so that's it. Then a thought hits my head like a stone - a request, it wants something. My hands begin to act on their own and reach for a backpack that got ripped open by some idiot a while back. I give it to the man... No, creature; it still had the hand on my shoulder and it wouldn't move an inch as if it was glued to the body part. Then it moved the other long bony hand to take the backpack and stared at me again. No one still paid attention except for the drunkard who was responsible for his "friend". Then it stood up, took its hand off of me and slid back into the woods. "Why are you talking to yourself, are you finally insane and we can take your loot now?" was what I heard next from one annoying bitch after that. They never noticed what had happened. Nothing. I don't want to stay near that bastard again, God knows what "friends" he'll bring over for us to play with next.</text>

		<text>Hey, listen, have you caught word of a guy called Black Digger? I heard that he used to be a really lucky fella, got himself a nice amount of rubles and a plethora of nice items as well. Some say that he had a secret stash of his own hidden deep among piles of junk and other crap. I'd really like to find him some day and beat the info out of him, but it seems like his secret has went together with him to the grave.</text>

		<text>It probably won't be long until you or I will be tasked with information recovery deep down in some derelict laboratory. X-18 is manageable, X-16 is tougher on your psyche and has more humanoids to fill with an extra hole or two, but you'd better prepare for Warlab. Not many make it there after the long trip as the path that leads to it takes you past the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant itself.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_18">
		<text>If you have a job that requires you to traverse central Pripyat to get to either Jupiter or the eastern part of Pripyat and its outskirts, use the Underpass to make it past central Pripyat undetected - you won't have to deal with the fanatics aboveground. You'll most likely have to deal with mutants — I met several ones almost a month ago — and will have to clear the place out, but they don't come back after an hour passes so you can safely use it to get back to the place which you first entered the Underpass from.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_19">
		<text>Be wary of machine gun nests scattered around certain strongholds and strategical locations. The gunner obviously cannot hit you when you're facing his back so sneaking up to him is a valid strategy as long as you don't screw up and make yourself known to everyone around him before managing to do so. Usually everyone will be in enough of a panic to not take over the fallen gunner's position. Don't forget about grenades as well, a well placed throw can be enough to take one out if you're in a pinch and cannot move out of cover anymore.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_20">
		<text>If you're looking to study various mutant species and artifacts as well, I suggest trekking to the Red Forest. It is teeming with wildlife, so keep your eyes open and keep a good weapon in your hands.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_21">
		<text>If you're looking for something exotic then check out the Red Forest. A Loner once sent a message to my PDA saying that he caught sight of a very valuable artifact in either a cave system or some other kind of an underground formation.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_22">
		<text>If you feel like taking a long stroll and taking out an outpost on your way to the bandit base in Dark Valley, I suggest turning east in the Cordon and going that way until you reach Darkscape. Sometimes a squad or two may also be on patrol there, but watch out for the mutants anyway. It's a relatively quiet place but those mutant shits don't care where to breed. As for the outpost I mentioned earlier, it is located approximately in the middle of the location. Our intelligence reports that Loners can sometimes be found there, so use this chance to eliminate the trespassers.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_23">
		<text>Looking for some info, eh? I can tell you that as long as you remain under our protection the mercenaries will not lay a finger on you. We are not worthy enough of being the target of their contractors any more because the previous leaders have been taken out, they've perished, vanished, kissed their life goodbye, whatever you want to call it. No one is looking to step up to take leadership again, besides, we'd bitch too much about this and that being wrong, in my opinion, at least. The only person so far who is keeping a watch over a small area is Sultan, but his hand obviously does not extend far enough to reach every bandit across the entire Zone. I don't think that he'll become big time and a juicy target for a mercenary attack, not like it bothers me that much in the first place.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_24">
		<text>Are you feeling like taking someone's ripe life? The Loners have always been and always will be a prime choice for that. We've been pissing them off since the dawn of time and those jackasses have always deserved to be messed around with. Most aren't armed with great weaponry but they do hate us enough to put up a nice fight so you can get both decent equipment and combat practice from them.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_25">
		<text>Hey, have you ever seen an orange midget making his way through dense reeds? I sure have and those garbage bags stand out so well that you can spot an ecologist a mile away without even needing to use your binoculars. Recently I've noticed that they've been using color variations that look less like the vomit inducing rubbish those scientists usually get issued.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_26">
		<text>The only thing that has less brains in its head than those darned Loners are the members of the Monolith faction. It's amusing to hear tales about them and their actions, they seem like the Zone's version of retards who can think about only one thing and nothing else. Too bad that their idiocy makes them fear death less.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_27">
		<text>Man, I remember tales about how long ago some guys sporting a scorpion on their patches kicked the shit out of some boys in blue pajamas. Everyone here always jokes about them and their clothing because they were weaker than a blind baby bloodsucker crawling in its nest. Seriously, can you believe that they actually were into science? Oh, wait, now that I remember it that does make sense, all the eggheads are bad at holding a gun in their hands, they just don't know how to live off from what the Zone gives to you like we do.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_28">
		<text>If only you knew what I'd give for a mutant wave large enough to overrun the Bar. Every single time when we try to get near it we get kicked out of it by those black and red fools. They've settled in there real well, even managed to set up a pair of PKMs to ward off intruders like us. They're armed pretty well, but their command structure... He-he, they're not the purest out of all in the Zone, secret deals had been conducted between us Bandits and Duty, but now they want everyone to keep their mouths shut and they don't want to see our mugs close to their own ones. God knows when they'll stop throwing a tantrum about their scarred pride.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_29">
		<text>Freedom used to boast about their strength and "freedom in the Zone". We showed them how much freedom can do here and they had to move their sorry asses far away from us. Nowadays they'll want you to think otherwise and that they switched bases because it's "safer from the mutants" or that "we can perform our duty of keeping the invaders at bay more easily". Remember, pal, it's all bullshit, they just don't want to admit that their superiors struck fear deep into their ranks.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_30">
		<text>The army boys don't show up as much as they used to back in the day. Word has spread that their operations have went down the gutter. I definitely wouldn't feel pleased to be commanded by some asshole who just wants me to rip a mutant pack or a stalker group apart for only his own benefit. They have it tough, sure, but it looks like their failures have actually managed to knock some sense into their skulls.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_31">
		<text>You probably already know about most of the mutant species found in the Zone. Here's something that may be completely new to you - parasites. They're known to be very elusive creatures. Most say that they dwell in the various ruins scattered around Dead City, even in some of the underground sewer sections. It's best to not be weak when approaching these things, they'll sap the life out of you and before you know it your brains will be eaten out by a black outgrowth that has managed to grow on your head. Then all what's left of you is a hollow shell which stumbles across the Zone like a zombie, infecting others with spores unleashed by this very same outgrowth. Sometimes the parasite takes fresh corpses as its "lair" to inhabit. Nasty stuff, isn't it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_32">
		<text>The advent of artifacts and their in-depth studying sometimes leaves me wondering how much worse things can get in the Big Land. These things possess untold properties, some so devastating that their incorporation into weapon technology could surpass anything made so far. Artifacts mixed in with explosive substances is nothing new here in the Zone, some have been practising the use of that for a while now, but just imagine what a fully fledged weapon built upon the harnessed energy of various kinds of artifacts could do!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_33">
		<text>I find it ironic how Freedom is the faction that keeps talking about the need to let everyone make use of the Zone, yet Duty members are the ones who come to Yantar to protect us and give artifacts to our leading scientists in order to help them with finding new ways to extinguish the Zone's life.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_34">
		<text>Scum, scum and nothing more than scum. That's all what the Bandits are and that's all what they always will be. They keep taking hostages to extort money and various valuables from those who hold the lives of these people dear, they don't care about honesty and keeping their word, not to forget about the fact that they act like idiots and the lowest forms of life. They have it better when someone smarter comes along, although they've been keeping low for a while now and no dedicated leader has stepped up yet to take control of every Bandit establishment around the whole Zone. Right now they're mostly sticking to small and organized groups scattered about. That makes it harder to instill confusion and panic amongst them when someone important kicks the bucket.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_35">
		<text>Some places can look more foreboding than they really are. Agroprom Underground serves as an example to this because right now various parts of it are closed off and the mutants don't have a lot of places to infest. For now, that is. I don't suggest going there unless you either want to dump your equipment there or actually try to scavenge something from all the junk that's lying around. Stashing your loot in a backpack in a hard to reach place aboveground would be a better idea than going underground anyway.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_36">
		<text>There are times when I wonder about our joint task of eliminating the Zone. It may be a dangerous place where it's normal to consider death an everyday thing, but... It can be fascinating at times. Just watching the world below you when you're sitting atop a watchtower or another tall structure, all the life running around, the wonderful formations the anomalies create, listening to the soothing music playing over at the Bar while watching night taking over day's place... That's what I like about the Zone, it's fatal but beautiful at the same time.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_37">
		<text>If I'm still going to have to sit here and do nothing other than pellet some puny mutants with my weapon then I'm going to have to reconsider my choice of joining Duty. Every day I get pushed around to do this and that but what do I get? Barely anything. I've been here for long enough to be dispatched to far more dangerous areas but it looks like a bunch of other guys have fallen into the same hole that I have. It's almost as if the top brass doesn't want to get down to really serious things and is just sitting safely in their bases until an opportunity comes so close that it can knock them out of their chairs.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_38">
		<text>Freedom may seem like a bunch of lunatics and people who are lazily sitting on their asses but they can be pretty slick when the need to be such comes to them. They've managed to spread misinformation about us before to reduce the faith of other stalkers in Duty. Besides that, they also keep on saying how protecting the Barrier is their doing and how much better it makes them than us whose base is located far before it. Don't even think about believing their bullshit, they haven't been protecting the Barrier that long and they never have played a large enough role in it, until they came over to crash at the warehouses, that is. We'll get back at them for trying to create a larger figure of authority about this "defending" later.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_39">
		<text>I've seen a lot of things in the Zone during my travels here, most of it has come from the times when I wasn't a part of Duty. Hell, the military stalkers are probably the toughest you'll ever meet, bar the lunatics who keep pouring in from the North. Unlike the military forces who don't go that deep into the Zone or haven't been here long enough, they have received special training or have experienced enough themselves, they possess equipment that easily outmatches that of most. They're fierce opponents in battle, sure, but if you're enough of a hotshot you can try taking them out on your own, though I wouldn't suggest doing so even though our ties with military stalkers are far, far more loose than the ones with the regular soldiers.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_40">
		<text>I'm sick of how everyone perceives us to be just a collective of potheads gathered around to do nothing other than praising the Zone and its creations. We really do try to spread useful information that we've acquired to those that need it, we take hostile action when it's needed and when there's enough danger, unlike Duty which likes to tell everyone otherwise while they're acting like a bunch of tough kids who do nothing other than beat up pathetic bandits and weak mutants.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_41">
		<text>Not many brave souls dare to venture to Limansk. That place is crawling with Monolith troops and mercenary squads, although mercs are the least of our problems for now. That place had been a ghost town that wasn't even on the map for quite a long amount of time, and it was so for a reason. One expeditionary squad's leader once told me how he and his guys decided to settle down in one of the buildings there which was not very close to Limansk's center to spend the night there. The town's not like some shanty despite its location, but I guess that the secrecy and unavailability of its position have done a fine enough job at keeping looters and whatnot at bay. So they silently prepared for the night, some stayed up to be on watch because the place is no amusement park. In the middle of the night something began clattering and knocking junk around. One of the sentries flashed some light at the spot where the sound came from and there was completely nothing worth his interest. Everything went back to being quiet again. Then he left his position to go back to the others except that to his surprise all the guards had vanished, meanwhile everyone else who was not gone was sleeping peacefully. The sentry had heard enough tales that we all always hear about, bloodsuckers and whatnot messing with you before taking your own life and all that other crap. He decided to not wander off and woke everyone up. It ended up being a night's worth of sleep lost for nearly everyone there. Later they found most of their missing guards in a lonely basement. No lock, no traps, nothing to keep others away from there. When they woke up they began to speak irrationally, like completely different beings. The squad's leader wanted to gather them up and get them out of there to see if anything could be helped, but when they were making their way past a bridge one of the messed up Freedomers raised his gun and fired a shot. One of the normal Freedom guys fell straight into the river, now dead. That's when all hell broke loose and the still sane members had to fight off the now crazed brethren. He said that it would've made a spectacular view, brother fighting against his own faction's brother. God knows what really had done such shit to them but the leader and a few of his guys made it through alive. He doesn't want to go to Limansk ever again and doesn't know whether to blame mutants or the Monolithians for that.</text>

		<text>Maybe one day when you'll become experienced enough you'll be allowed to use our tunnel system that leads to various places around the Zone. It's a great way to cut down travel time and is very safe as well.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_43">
		<text>We've conducted many operations in the Zone. A bunch of them have been punitive expeditions caused by trespassers not knowing how to properly act here in the Zone. Not many want to bother with contacting us, I mean, we're here to keep newcomers away from this place, but... Life isn't just luxury here so we have to sometimes cut new paths through both in traversing the geographical features of the Zone and the minefields of acquiring deals between us and traders that hold enough influence over a certain area. Unfortunately, doing so has cost some valuable assets of ours to die because the actions of some of them had been found out and they got lynched.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_44">
		<text>One of the figures that we consider to be rather important is Forester. He has a keen eye on finding various paths through the dense forest, but, alas, his old age has got the best of him and he can't help himself that much outside his safe haven any more. He provided valuable assistance to Scar, thus being able to provide help to Lebedev. Forester can still be found in the Red Forest, I believe that he'll remain there for the rest of his life until he'll wither away enough to remain as just a memory imprinted in our minds.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_45">
		<text>A couple of years ago we were led by Lebedev. Those were dog days, until a Merc came along and helped us get our footing in the swamps. But then the whole Strelok thing got out of hand. Most of Clear Sky followed Lebedev and the Merc north to sort it all out. Well, you know how that went. Anyway, we keep hearing about the Death Truck in the Cordon, bringing back old friends. On the rare occasion there's some signs of life, but it's like they've had a massive stroke or something. I guess that's why they call it the Death Truck.</text>

		<text>New in the zone? Listen to yourself, you almost sound like one of those bastards out there. Information huh, ever heard of Major Kuznetsov? He was a real piece, after he replaced Major Khaletskiy for the trouble he was causing, Kuznetsov goes and does the same thing! It's always the high ranking officers that are corrupted, they get a little taste of power and control and then start trying to make extra on the side through the criminals here in the zone! I heard he met with a terrible fate when he crossed paths with that one guy.. I can't recall his name but they picked him up in Pripyat I heard because he had some real imporant information.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_47">
		<text>We've got more guys getting dropped in later in the month. Just waiting for the Zone to give us some quiet time, so the pilots can make it in and out. Rumour has it there's some French, Finnish and British operatives coming in this time. Should be interesting.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_information_48">
		<text>Things may be rough out here, but it doesn't mean the research has stopped. We're managing with handmade gear, and now and again we manage to grab equipment from the Ecologists, from an old friend. You'd be surprised at what we know about anti-coagulation from Bloodsuckers, and lens repair from Flesh eyes.</text>

	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_0">
		<text>I really don't have any advice to give you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_1">
		<text>When that cold sweat hits you after you haven't eaten for more than a day, that is exactly when your immune system goes on a fritz and you couldn't hold a pencil steady, let alone a machine gun. People start hallucinating and walk into trouble or right off a cliff. Fill that cavity in your belly at least once a day, and if you can't afford Beards delicious delicacies, then eat some worm infested meat that you cut out from a mutant. Worms are excellent when compared to, well.. death. I've seen people on the outside handle whole months without food, but here, the Zone drains you. Drains your spirit, your will and your body. Don't hesitate to snack on Snorks if you really have to. If nobody sees you, it shouldn't really be a problem.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_2">
		<text>I've seen grown men turn into crying babies here. They can't keep up. Athletes that have superb physical conditions,  drop like flies after a few exercises here in the Zone. There is something that this place takes away from you each day, and it doesn't give it back. I could lift 30 kilos of weights before I came here. Now I can barely lift a grenade when faced with a swarm of Tushkanos. It might be the fear too, whatever it is, it's like a a heavy burden we all carry, we all share. Next time you want to drop a bandit when you have the upper hand, remember what I said about the burden, he is carrying it too, just like you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_3">
		<text>Next time you are faced with a pack of dogs, try running directly towards them, it might actually save your ass from turning into dog food. We eat them, they eat us, it's a symbiotic thing. But yeah, feel free to try this out, but leave your weapons behind so you could run faster and be more intimidating. You could leave them with me, I can safeguard them while you try this out for yourself. This shit works, but most Stalkers are fucking cowards and they don't have anything between the legs to try it out.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_4">
		<text>Get a good knife, one of those blades that could shave the balls off of a boar just by looks alone. You know the ones, quality brand knifes. Get some oil on the knife, make it nice and shiny so you could see your reflection in it. Then stab some poor fool in the throat with it, jam that blade deep and wiggle it a bit. Soon enough he will start bleeding out and loosing consciousness, but a few seconds before that, stare deep in his eyes. That way, he will take your face to his grave, and the underworld would know of you. I've done this to countless people here, and I bet down under the ground, they know my name and surname by now. When they know of you there, there is no reason to send their minions for you. I haven't seen a freaking bloodsucker for months now, they know me. This is how I will survive longer than these other cowards.</text>

		<text>I played the violin back home. Was one of the best, I even had the chance to meet the president twice. I knew the strings so well, I could caress them in ways other violinists could only dream of. When I was recruited in the army, I though I'd do my duty, get through a couple of years for my country, then get back to doing what I love. They sent me here, right after bootcamp, and I've been here ever since. Back home, they expect of me to return to my previous glory and brilliance, but they don't know what happened here. It's this evil shit, the radiation or the Zone itself. It seeps into me each day, and my hands tremble, my bones hurt. I play some guitar once in a while, but that piece of rotten wood of an instrument sounds like Chimera claws ripping your guts. And it sure feels like that every time they make me play it. I feel that the guitar takes me back a bit closer to the beauty of before, the strings, the music, but at the same time it burns me deeply knowing that I could never be that person again. If only I had a violin here, any old thing would do, I could maybe once again take a whiff of the time before I died inside.</text>

		<text>Before all these scientists and mechanics came to the Zone, Stalkers used to hold artifacts in these makeshift belts with crude boxes attached to them. A whole generation of Stalkers are now sterile and slowly dying, their insides turning into liquid that they have to puke out once in a while. I don't know how they stay sane, how they don't just off themselves. If those simple boxes were cracked only a little bit, the radiation slowly entered their bodies, and that happened quite often. Now we have artifact containers that are built quite well. I've seen bullets bouncing off of those contraptions, they make them as rough as those black boxes on airplanes. We have it easy now, the first wave of Stalkers that conquered the Zone were the true heroes. They didn't have any manuals, all the tools and the comfort of bases. They had to invent new ways to survive. Those boys were pioneers.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_7">
		<text>I had a buddy, a kind of familiar friend that fought off two Chimeras. Two hulking monstrosities of flesh and claws and very often, filled with a fair share of human flesh in their stomach. He had his back to a wall, down on his last 20 buckshots and a few bombs. He was a good aim, but that is not why he survived. He had a few of these stimpacks. I call them boosters, because they sure work fast. Whenever the Chimeras struck him down and he thought he couldn't get up again, he would fix himself up with those things. Crafty fellow that one. The human body is actually quite the resilient mother fucker. We are usually used to non life threatening situations and our bodies don't have to fight off two headed beasts to stay alive very often, but when they do, it works wonders if you have a reminder for the body in hand, so you could boost up and handle the situation quickly and efficiently. I don't know what long term consequences those chemical nightmares have, but if you care about long term consequences, you wouldn't be prying your head around in the Zone.</text>

		<text>Shit ain't rosy outside either. My mom used to send me some cookies with sugar every few weeks, and some letters on how they are doing. She always keeps a brave face, writing how everything is just dandy and they are quite content, but I can see that the cookies have less and less sugar every month, and the handwriting is getting worse too. She used to use clean white paper when writing to me. Now it's this awful greasy paper probably found in some shit dumpster. I can't get the nerve to ask how they are doing. I'm scared shitless of what they would say to me, even though I already know. I just don't want to read about it if it's written by her. The mental image of my folks being OK is what keeps me going around here, I don't care if it's false, I've got nothing else anymore. I send them whatever I can from here. Yesterday I sent them some money that I made by selling off the last of my food rations. I'd be OK, I could always try my luck at the anomaly casino. Loosing a bet there isn't the most healthy thing in the world but I'd take my chances.</text>

		<text>I've got it man, I've got the bug. They told me like it didn't mean shit to them, like reading a booklet on varieties of kittens. They told me I had AIDS and even told me to leave when I was shocked. Fuck those people you know? They study for so long to be perfect doctors, with a career and everything, but they end up being desensitised to everything. Like talking to a Snork. The Snork would've reacted more man, this shit ain't right. And I have to pay heaps of money every month to get the anti-retrovirals. That shit does not come cheap, not even that knockoff Chinese shit that is only available in the Zone. I might be getting placebo pills for all I know, I still feel like shit. The Zone is the best that I can do right now. And here I am, 3 years and counting. But I see you have your own shit to take care of, so just walk away like everyone does. Just leave me the fuck alone.</text>

		<text>Money. Cash. Cold hard chunks of bills with as many zero's as possible. I can see your eyes light up like a peak of an emission. So I guess I have your attention now. But it's no walk in the park, and not everyone does it, and that is why it's so rewarding. I don't tell this shit like this to anyone you know? You look like the right guy, so listen up. Listen very carefully and try to remember every single word I tell you. What you should do to get filthy rich, very quickly is: "WORK HARD AND DON'T WHINE ALL THE TIME". You lazy fucking bastard. Stop talking to me immediately and go mind your own bloody business.</text>

		<text>The moment I took a single step inside the Zone, was the first moment I felt really free. It was also the first moment I've ever realized that I didn't feel free back home. I though I was fine, working the docks, bringing in some good money, joking around with friends. I had the average Joe's dream life. Some people think I'm insane for leaving all that for the Zone. Some get even angry, one little shit tried to strike me with his freaking gun. These people don't know how to live, how to breathe in a new day, with new possibilities and new challenges. I know it's hard, but if you manage to survive here, even a single day, you've done more than any of the people back home would ever do. We've lost it man, as a humanity, we've been over-civilized, and have lost what it means to be alive. You've got constant reminders for that here, none back home. Just yesterday I was taking a dump in some bushes, like a real Stalker, and these bees just appeared. Angry little bitches I covered my face with my gasmask and started running. I was so focused one running that I ran directly to a herd of hungry dogs. From there on, my day started, and those 5 kilometers I ran, were the daily reminder that I was alive and free.</text>

		<text>There was this broad I knew, and I knew her well, if you know what I mean. But that bitch was just fucked up, she always checked where I was, kept calling me, leaving me strange messages. I told her this shit between us wouldn't work. She went fucking insane and started hitting me. See I have nothing against hitting a woman, actually its quite a relief of pent up frustration, especially with a psycho like that bitch. So I left her in front of the hospital. I think that was cool enough for my right? I know some guys that would bury her corpse or chop her up so she could fit in the drains. I'm a good guy you see, I take care of my bitches, but when they give me shit, that's it, I snap. Fuck I'd really want to do her right now.</text>

		<text>Don't wait for the siren before an emission. The sirens are always too late and if you are not near something deep underground, or some solid thick concrete, you will get fried quite nicely. To stay one of those people that hasn't been fried yet, or made dead, keep one eye towards the sky. If you see this cumulonimbus type of cloud formation, haul ass. Do it quickly. If a Snork cave is the only available thing, go for it. You'd love those Snorks compared to what the emission would do to you. So remember, when a thick vertical cloud formation appears in the sky, that looks as if God is puking his entrails from  up above, that is when you say goodbye with all your heavy items, and sprint towards a safe spot. I had this one guy that wanted a tour around the Zone, he was some rich brat, constantly high on some shit, and drunk. Well that prick had the an opportunity to witness an incoming emission, and instead of taking cover like non-idiots like us, he stayed outside so he could watch the "beauty of the emission". His words were these. Some nice loot I picked up from his scarred carcass, and one torn picture of a cute girl. Shit that photo is probably doing the rounds right now among the Stalkers.</text>

		<text>This place isn't made for the likes of me. I'm not made for the likes of this place. I'm talking about the world, not the Zone. I've been having these clusterfuck migraines since I was little. My folks though I was lying all the time and told me to "suck it up". Only when I started bleeding from my ears on a regular basis they started to take notice. It was all to late naturally, I was much older then, and I decided to pack my things and say hi to the Zone. My migraines miraculously decreased once I came here. I was overjoyed. For a first ever, that I could remember, I had this weight lifted off of me, it felt very liberating. I could smell things, I could focus my eyes well and concentrate on the good things for a change. So I started really enjoying my life, when I actually came to what many people call hell. Most were perplexed by my demeanor and I made some enemies along the way. You can't fit in over here unless you have that dreary, miserable outlook. They wouldn't accept me as one of them, neither duty nor freedom. I took it upon myself to find somewhere to live, further away from the pessimism of regular Stalkers. I stayed in this makeshift hut made of metal parts, buried under some concrete slabs. I was quite content, and seemed to survive the emissions quite well, but there was this familiar feeling coming back to me. It's familiarity even made me a bit nostalgic, before I realized the migraines were coming back. Now they are worse than before, my ears burn up, I can't see well, and I can barely hold a gun because of those old friends, the clusterfucks. I just want to end everything now.</text>

		<text>Holy shit I can't take this anymore. The ladies, I really miss em'. I had a ton of girls back home, they liked the muscular types, I liked the big boobs type. We had an understanding. But here, I haven't even seen a female nipple from a kilometer. And I'm not touching those magazines Beard sells. They're all greasy and sticky, I don't want to know how they became that way. They had so many women before 1986, before this place became a radioactive desert. Parties, music. Communist music, but music nonetheless. Now I get turned on by their ghosts. I think of how many fish there was in the pond at Skadovsk or Yanov. I bet there was enough tail to last a life time. This is bullshit, I gotta get laid. Hey on a completely unrelated note, do you know where that herd of Fleshes was killed recently? I'm actually going for a walk.</text>

	<string id="dm_tips_16">
		<text>You know that quick release system? That thing saved my ass from a massive herd of boars and fleshes. I looted some very, very nice things from what looked like a duty graveyard. There was bodies littered with guns, artifacts, I couldn't believe my eyes. I actually left some artifacts behind, and I never do that, ever. But I was packed to the gills, and felt like a mule right before his back snapped. So it was time to cash it in I thought. While I was slowly walking towards the base, I was praying inside: "not now, please not now, just not today, please", and then the low pitched breath of a boar cut my prayer in half. I started running away from the sound, but this air is not good enough for that. It was like made of 95% nitrogen, I breathed in, and I was choking. Then the decision came, I had to cut the loot loose. When that backpack slammed to the ground like a fucking meteor, I sprang forward with gazelle like grace and what do you know, the air had oxygen in it once again. Later I came back to the stash, some artifacts were missing, but there was also some blood and a nice chunk of what looked like human flesh near it. Someone tried to take a swipe at the backpack, but was probably hunted down by those boars. Maybe they were guarding it while I was gone. I have newfound respect for boars. Haven't eaten boar meat since.</text>

		<text>Sometimes there is ample food variety. You could snack on some nuts, fairly good meat or clean bread. But there is other times, whenever those emissions hit hard and often, where restocking isn't so easy, so the choices are either to eat shit, or dine on some shit. The irradiated chops Beard sells all over the Zone could satisfy your hunger, but those radiated particles must be washed down with something clean, like water or something stronger. There was this fat bastard that chugged down some 20 pieces of this infested grilled shit. He was so fucked up later, other Stalkers had to feed him antirad pills, and he had to pay them back later. Even eating food is dangerous here, so watch what you stuff your mouth with and you would be "almost fine" more often.</text>

		<text>I'm an ex-military, trained by the best, nurtured to be a killing machine. I might look thin and scrawny, but underneath that are resilient and strong muscles. You wouldn't know what I'm talking about, I could break your neck before you could say ouch. Just don't fuck with me and you'd be all right. I've rammed my fists into so many boars, I don't waste ammo on those beasts. I punch them in their ugly faces until they just give up on life. I could show you if I wasn't so busy all the time. You should man up, do some push ups, don't be such a chicken fuckup huh? I'm sick of everyone wanting my help taking down this Chimera, or sniping that Controller from afar. I broke the Controller's neck, I don't snipe things, like a coward. For me, it's only close and personal. Sadly not everyone respects what I do properly. Some of these bitch Stalkers would tell you that I'm making all this up. Don't you believe a word that comes out of their filthy lying holes, they're just jealous at my strength and prowess. Just don't tell them that I said this OK?</text>

		<text>I was once a lot like you, frightened, defenceless and just an awfully pitiful sight to look at. I fixed my shit immediately after I was almost raped with those boar tusks. The drill you open just for the fun of it, I saw that happen to my buddy, who kind of took one for the team I guess. I threw away my gun and ran towards cover like there is an emission. The first thing you have to do is get one of those armors, some thick stuff that would separate you from this awful environment. The more things you put between you and the freaks and monsters of the outside, the better off you come out. There was this guy, he bought some modified exo, and just equipped it with every single Kevlar piece he could find. He looked like a bloody Christmas tree and attracted a shitload of animals, but somehow, he always got through. The canon he was carrying sure helped increase his odds, but that exo with Kevlar works wonders here. I'm this close to getting one of those, If I didn't have to feed the leeches back home.</text>

		<text>Never trust those doctor fuckups. My granddad and grandma both got butchered by a doctor. It was officially attributed to something else, but that doc was fucking drinking before the op. He reeked of booze and my granddad had to do the operation right then and there. These Zone doctors aren't any better, they'd charge you for fixing up a scratch, as if they've done a brain transplant twice. I'd take my chances healing on my own. What I do is I'm very careful no to get hurt, like obsessively careful, I don't drink nor I do I do any smack. But when I do get hurt, I just eat well, stay hydrated and plop one of those emergency med kits. It usually is a bit cheaper, but most importantly, if I fuck myself up, I'd have only me to blame. I really don't want to end up like my grandparents, all cut up for no fucking reason.</text>

	<string id="dm_tips_23">
		<text>I got one for you. NEVER STEAL FROM BASES. You can take anything you want outside, whoever grabs it first, it's his. We aren't really fond of thieves around here. Even the bandits know to keep their hands off of other peoples shit. But if you do happen to be found stealing inside a base, if you are extremely lucky, you'd only be hanged by your intestines by a tree.</text>

	<string id="dm_tips_24">
		<text>I have seen these bitches, too careful what they eat, go broke from buying all this imported delicacies. I have seen idiots throw up all the food they just bought, because they didn't really care about the rads. Both of those fuckers are wrong. You need to have balance, Zen like you know? As Aristotle said... some shit about that. When you can spare the time, swallow some shitty meat boiled in shittier stuff, when you need to be "on the go", imported is what you need. Remember these things, and you could buy yourself some shooter that won't break down after three shots at sucker.</text>

		<text>Back in the military in my home country, we used to stuff our feet into the shoes along with some cloth, no socks. Those things were comfy if you know how to wrap your foot well, but most people were shit at it, and they had bruises the size of tushkanos on their feet. But they dried well, they lasted a lifetime, and most importantly, they could be used for other "non approved" ways. Smart guys used to carry two pairs of those wraps along. Whenever one pair gets wet, they replace it with another, their feet always in a perfect shape, you could eat with those feet if they had longer fingers. Those were the pansies that got shot first. They were always too careful. Smart doesn't always work you know.</text>

	<string id="dm_tips_26">
		<text>Sometimes it's not worth it. When you have a mountain of loot, and dogs are nibbling on your tail, then it's time to chunk some shit. Calculate what is worthwhile, if its heavy and worthless, then you can casually leave a present for your attackers behind you. If it's small, light and expensive, then you don't part with it till you reach base. I used to throw away things like that while running, and there would be a trail of stupid junk behind me.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_27">
		<text>I save everything, I have never sold anything to any one of those greedy bastard salesmen in the Zone. I keep everything in secret stashes all over the Zone, and they are really hard to find. I hoard things, and it's not useless things like most people say. One day they would turn out useful, and I will stick it to all those amateur psychologists that diagnose me with ailments they've read in old magazines left before Chernobyl.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_28">
		<text>Some people only react when threatened. When you really need some loot, try shooting your pray in the legs or hands. When they loose their wits because of the agony, or just become scared shitless, you'd want to have a nice chat with them, ask them where their stash is. Some fools would tell you, and after that, you could do with them whatever you want. I caught a bandit and cut his trigger finger, saw him firing with the other hand at some Stalkers. Should've cut his head that rat bastard.</text>

	<string id="dm_tips_29">
		<text>The Zone has no mercy, ever. The Zone is living proof that God either does not exists, or doesn't give a fuck. Although he could be this mean bastard that wants to torture us, but that is almost beside the point. Don't expect anything good from anyone here. If I saw you with enough loot, barely breathing and outside of a base, I'd take a shot at you, do not think I won't. We are good here, but outside, it is different. The Zone makes it's own rules, and we abide and navigate either through or around them.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_30">
		<text>Respect men, people and the Zone. Always have at least a grain of respect, because without respect we are just like the fiends outside, howling because of their primal urges. Respect is what brings people to the Zone and allows them to stay here. It doesn't care what or how you came here, who you are or where you come from, the Zone will cut you down if you forget respect. I keep a reminder to respect the Zone right here in my pocket, always. It's a part of my left foot. One of those gravity anomalies almost sucked me in, and threw a piece of my foot 20 meters away. Had to crawl there while bleeding, to maybe bring it back at base so they attempt to stitch it. But it was a bit late, and now I carry it here. If you don't want to keep a reminder like this to keep you from forgetting respect, then you should always keep a reminder in your head.</text>

	<string id="dm_tips_31">
		<text>I came here with only one thing and because of it, I'm still here and not lying in a ditch somewhere, half eaten by mutants. My switchblade has been with my ever since boot camp. And I do take care of it, every time some gunk gets stuck into the mechanism, every time dirt and sand comes into contact with my knife, I make sure to make it sparkly clean afterwards. I mean that is common sense if you want things to last you for life. And this cutter was made to accompany you all your life, if you took care. I cut meat, cut mutants, cut bandits and I even cut myself when I need some nasty insect larva removed. You can use it to open cans, open old locks, open up screws, open up someones belly because they can't take a hint. Ammo you spend, grenades even more so, the knife stays with you forever, and it's a mark. It marks exactly what kind of a person you are.</text>

	<string id="dm_tips_32">
		<text>You know why these fools carry around teeth with them? They think the teeth of their enemies, especially golden teeth, carry the souls of their owners, so when shit hits the ventilator and the fan, at the same time, you have someone to watch your back. The idiots don't realize how stupid they are, ghosts don't have eyes, nor mouths, they can't even use a weapon for fucks sake. How exactly are they going to watch your back now huh? I stuff people like that with my uniquely produced knives and bullets. After I'm done stuffing them, I take their cherished golden teeth and sell them to whoever wants it.</text>

	<string id="dm_tips_33">
		<text>I have no friends, I have familiar faces. I know that guy, that guy sold me some food once, another one smiles like an idiot all the time. I don't even remember their names, they drop like flies so fast, it's not really worth it. And new ones come in by the hundreds, it's really like flies going head first into those fluorescent lights, just to be fried in an instant. That's a fitting description of the Zone I think. Friends get you killed around here. What happens when he guts surrounded by the snorkies, and you have to "save" him because he's such a good friend? You die, right there and then. Instead of one person dead, now there is two. My only real friend is my gun, and if you have even a semblance of interest in staying alive, then you should really do the same thing.</text>

		<text>My family is shit, is rather in the shit. How you say, they have bad time home. No food, no money. I send them money in this gray box, but they say only half comes to them. Always someone takes half. When I find that shit, I will rape his face with my knife.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_35">
		<text>Do not touch junk that is not your own. Whatever it is. If it's bottled AIDS? Do not throw it out, unless you yourself has not filled it with AIDS. Even if you see a hundred thousand in cash, and you think that you could run out of the Zone and live like a king for a few months. You will get hunted down like a bloody animal, and your life will end soon after. Keep your hands to yourself and to the things you personally own, everything else should be invisible to you. I hate telling this to every fucking shit newbie out here. No manners these fucks.</text>

	<string id="dm_tips_36">
		<text>I've done it all man, I've been here for so long, I've seen waves of Pseudodogs wash over bases. Pseudogiants fighting between themselves, I've even seen controllers talk with people. Yeah I've seen that. I smoked a ton of ganja before that sure, but that was to prevent my head from exploding near those screeching auras these Controllers have. Whatever you do, just keep calm, and concentrate on either running away from the sound, or the iron balls manoeuvre, where you run towards the sound and prepare to unload everything you have into their head. Would not recommend that one though. I've seen strong men weep like little bitches when they fail that one. Soon after they get mind bended so much that they aren't even people anymore.</text>

	<string id="dm_tips_37">
		<text>Naturally I'm the perfect man for this place. I'd say that I've got exactly what it takes to make it here. I was swinging through a bunch of prisons throughout east Europe before coming here. Some of those places had better prisons than some grade A hotels. Jesus there was room service in one of them, why would I repent my crimes when that shit was fantastically good? I managed to escape from the last one, I shived a guard, he had kids, I didn't give not one fuck about it. I came here, at least the prison here is much much larger. I felt like I had tasted freedom once again, and that's who I joined up immediately when I arrived. Duty has their links with the law. Me and the law don't get along quite perfectly. Some of the pussies in freedom tell me I'm a monster, but once the real monsters come by, guess who's services are once again needed? I can cut up a man faster than a pig, so they use me against duty whenever the situation calls for it.</text>

	<string id="dm_tips_38">
		<text>In here, you are either with people, or the mutant beasts roaming for food and fucking. If you are a beast, you get hunted for sure, if you are and act like a person, you might not get shot up. We stick together, and that is why there is human settlements here, the tip of hells tongue. If we didn't stick together, this would be a wasteland of unseen proportions. Even if it's a bandit roach, keep him alive, shoot him in the foot and get his stash, but leave him be. There is barely any people here, and you going around wasting good folks is not in any one's interest. I know you want to be Rambo and can't wait to squeeze the trigger, but you won't be Rambo for long here. Rambo doesn't survive in the Zone well.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_39">
		<text>Those fucks think they have it better than us. It is them that are prisoners, prisoners of comfort, prisoners of taking the easier path. They wouldn't last here. Not one of them would make it one day, it's going either going to be the food, or the air, or the hellspawns walking like they own the God damn place. If the Zone gets bigger and engulfs the whole world, we will be the most experienced, and at the top, not them. They'd be hiding in some greasy corner with bags of gold and useless money. Try nibbling on a piece of gold, it doesn't do shit. I love their condescending tone, every time some new fart comes in and speaks to us. It's like we are living in some gutters, and they've come here to enlighten us. There was once a Christian mission, or a Muslim prophet, some shit like that. He came with food and medicine, promising the salvation of our souls and virgins. Lot's of virgins. Not one Stalker bought his bullshit. Natural selection weeds out the idiots, or rather the Zone does the weeding out, and those that are left? They don't value bullshit very highly. The guy that did the "enlightening" was enlightened himself when he stepped into a lightning anomaly. He survived, but he was badly burned and went back home immediately.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_40">
		<text>I heard of this guy that came to the Zone and refused to fire any weapons. He was a pacifist of some sort. Coward by my book, but that is irrelevant. Yeah, and he decided to survive here, make some money, by helping the traders out, packing supplies, cleaning blood off of the beds, all those little things. At first, nobody respected him, they considered him a fool. After a while he started to grow on people, and they started to be dependent of him. He'd know who needs what, where and how. He actually sent money to that shitty country in eastern Europe that he came from. Imagine that, making money in the Zone without weapons? He is still a coward, but a crafty one indeed. He still has never left the confines of the base, and send letters with cash back home. I think he had some family there.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_41">
		<text>Trading works around here because of one reason: "shitty crook traders gut fucked very quickly". There was one lad, look like an all right soldier that one. He started selling trinkets that were supposed to be half-artifacts. People bought it for a while, carried them around like a new fashion trend in the Zone. That kid got some money his way, started selling them to more experienced Stalkers, but they don't buy bullshit as you might have learned by now. So they took the so called artifacts to the scientists, they did some research and guess what happened to the kid? He might still be hanging by those cranes up in Zaton, by his intestines. They didn't kill him immediately, no. They just ripped him open like a bag of chips, and hanged him by his guts to be pecked by birds like Prometheus. That is the way the die. I bet a lot of people saw that, and a lot of hopeful crooks took note and downsized their business to zero.</text>

		<text>I had that fucker as a landlord back in Kiev. He was a shitbag then, he's a shitbag now. He's even a worse shitbag now. I went in debt, did a little of those "games", had to try out my luck. I don't do that anymore, mostly because everything goes to the "landlord". He owns me man, I've thought about putting a bullet through his head, but I'm not one of those people. It seems like I could never repay the debt I have, and I just go deeper and deeper. I think he's making money off of me. At least my family back in the apartment have a roof over their head. That is the least that I can do for them. He does take care of that part. I studied to become a technician, not a fucking hunter. Whenever I cut my knife deep into some poor flesh, all I can think is how disgusting this is, but how this would keep my family dry and safe back home. Should've accepted that job at the bank, what a stupid fool I was back then. I had some superficial ideologies about the world, and thought banks were just plain evil. You know, I thought banks were evil, but gambling isn't. I deserve rotting here in the Exclusion Zone.</text>

		<text>You should be a rock, standing alone against waves of shit and gore that the Zone provides. But every rock needs its base. Nobody survives alone here. Either the mutants get to you, or if you are one of those nimble motherfuckers, some non animal shit would get to you. Try eating a Zone meat only diet. After a day or two, you'd throw up more than you eat, it's really not worth it. The cancer diagnosis is really not worth it too, but who the hell makes it here long enough to be diagnosed with cancer, or actually die from cancer? That shit takes a while to develop and slowly engulf your major organs with excess tissue. So be resourceful and go to one of the bases once in a while. Unload, unwind and meet some people, one of those people might drag your unconscious ass back to base when a controller says "hello".</text>

		<text>They say keep your friends close, and your enemies closer. I like to keep everyone as close as possible. I keep an eye open at all times. Try catching me off guard, even when I'm sleeping. I'm always alert and ready to kick some ass. But traveling alone is fucked up. I only travel with other Zone men. They know their fair share of terror, and they can keep their wits when everything turns upside down and you can barely notice a difference between a person and a mutant. You know, I'd love to keep them mutants close, but they do bite, and they bite in deep. There was this one guy that kept a pseudodog, not sure how he tamed him, but that is one bad ass mother fucker right there.</text>

Sometimes it just burns you until there is nothing but dust, some times electricity fries you like well done bacon. The worst for me is those Psy storms. They speak to you, and you can't "not" listen. The sound that emission creates is so penetrating you could barely hear your own thoughts. They say those kind of storms are actually pent up psychic energy of those controller mutants. So if you see a cumulonimbus cloud formation, stop whatever you were doing, and start working your way back to base. Emissions are the Zone's way to tell you: "you need a break".</text>

		<text>I have these growths under my armpit and around my neck, doc says he can't do anything and when I ask him what it is, he just goes silent. Like a fucking light switch turned off in his brain. Don't know what the fuck that is, but I live with it. They are slowly getting bigger, I can't sleep on my back anymore and the jacket I used to wear? I can barely zip it up. I might just be getting fat, I don't know, but who the hell gets fat in the Zone? I rub some imported Vodka on my back and neck, and the tightness disappears for a while. Most think I'm a drunk because I reek of Vodka all the time, and I go to bed with a Vodka bottle. I've never tasted alcohol in my life, it's a religious thing you probably wouldn't understand. Fuckit, I'll just head over to that other doc, he's always more helpful anyway.</text>

		<text>You know that old newbie that hangs around the Yanov station? He's still a newbie for a good fucking reason. He tried to take some loot from another friend, without him noticing. I'd call this theft, but the newbie is a good guy, and I don't want to see him hanging on a tree. So he took the stuff from his friend, and ran towards some stash he had in mind. We knew what he's doing all along, but tracked him because we wanted to find out how he deals with this. Strangely he returned all the loot and apologised to his friend for his nasty outburst of borrowing without permission. He's been at Yanov ever since, washing dishes, tending to crates, moving ammo boxes. That's what you get when you fuck with other peoples loot. Well not really, you get to hang by your intestines on a tree, but that's what you get when you return the liberated goods back to the original owner without having to do so. He's a good guy that one, but we all have our moments.</text>

		<text>I had them in my sights, these mercs that were tormenting some Stalker by the rocks near Zatons plant. I could snipe them off in 4 seconds and it would've ended right there and then. I kept my cool, and it really paid off because another dozen of mercs came afterwards. I didn't have enough bullets for all of them. I mean I don't miss, I don't waste any bullets. I count every bullet by the price. If I shot ten bullets, I'd have to know that I'd have to make "at least" that amount from their loot to break even. This is good strategy for any visitor or long term Zone man here. When they left the man, he was in so much pain, I had to use one of my subsonic rounds with the suppressor, so I don't attract too much attention. That was the one time I didn't calculate how much that bullet was worth. It was probably worth everything to that tortured Stalker.</text>

		<text>Nobody knows what the hell makes the Pecker sound. Some think its mutants, controllers. Other say its the weather. Still others claim it is antennas used for secret communication, but those are only rumors. What we know is that the Zone amplifies the signal and spreads it over a wider area, affecting any electronic device capable of emitting sound. It pecks at your mind that one. Some people go insane from the sound, running into a bore lair or an anomaly. Never fall asleep near one, you won't wake up the same. It fucks with your subconscious mind, you wake up with these unintelligible numbers and word combinations that make no sense. I don't quite understand what that is, and I don't want to find out really. I just keep a well off distance between me and those sounds.</text>

		<text>If you see the Z's, all faceless and slow, don't just spray them with bullets. That's like wasting money on slots. You won't come out better. They are tough little corpses, and it would be doing anything by shooting wherever. Shooting them in their spine or a head shot would finish the job well. Then they'd get down and stay down for good. I've seen people unload a crate full of ammo in those things, and each bullet missed the sweet spot. Don't waste your time and money like that and shoot, but shoot good. Knowing this would make you much less filled with bullet holes, and I'm sure you'd favor that over the alternative right?</text>

		<text>Come, sit with me. Have a drink and relax. The Zone is unforgiving, but that doesn't mean Stalkers should be as well right? We should enjoy these brief moments because we might not be able to again. I knew this Stalker that was always worried that he would get mauled by some mutant, always kept an eye out for anything. Every little sound shook him to the core and he reacted like it was the last thing he does. Although he is still alive, he is quite broken up, mumbling things instead of talking. If he took my advice to relax, he'd be a different person now, but to each his own.</text>

		<text>There was this one time, I had to fight off two hulking Chimeras and these were no normal Chimeras. These had three heads man, that was insane. If you took care of two of the faces with the shotgun, there was one more left. But it was no problem for my skills you know? I kicked those cerberus bitches ass so hard they bled a river of blood. I've done a ton of those things man. I once went to Pripyat, after hearing all the stories of how fucked up it was. I had to get there, check it out myself. There was thousands of Tushkanos, 50 monolith squads at every step, for real. I took down plenty of them but I couldn't carry anymore loot, so I got back here. By the way, do you have any idea how to release the safety on this piece of shit pistol? I couldn't figure it out it's a new gun for me.</text>

I'm going to tell you exactly that, and it doesn't even involve firing a gun. I know it sounds too good to be true, but that is not a good enough reason to dismiss it. What I need from you is only an initial sum of money, think of it as an investment. And get this, it's going to spit out a return, ten times what you invested. I found this guy, that knows this other guy, that sets all this up. It's all legit you could ask around, but that would just make other Stalkers wanting to cash in, and this deal might not be on the table for long if that happens. Think about it and bring in the dough when you are nice and ready.</text>

The results would always weigh in heavily, even unanimously, against you being alive. You've been elected to be dead, by the Zone. Why would you not agree with them? You know what keeps me moving and talking here? These kind of conversations. Not Vodka, not Cocaine nor those wonderful porn mags Beard distributes in return for a hefty fee, it's simple chats with simple people like you.

		<text>They put some garbage in the imported tobacco that is sold here, it reduces the effects of radiation and helps the body recover. Some miracle shit the Ukrainian government came up with when they had to deal with the first Chernobyl explosion. So smoking one off after eating some shitty cyst infested meat from the Zone, really works wonders. Unless you want to spend the whole day puking and get cancer in a few years. We are all sterile anyway, our balls can't handle the radiation, and those that aren't sterile, have defective sperm. Imagine watching your beautiful wife give birth to a disgusting mutant, just because you spent a few months in the Zone back in when you were young? Everything has consequences, or at least that's what the doctors say.</text>

		<text>Tag along with larger groups when you are not prepared for the horror of being alone. They won't mind unless you keep waving a shooter in their faces. That way, you get the safety of numbers, you have more fun and you might learn a thing or two from their conversations. You could also learn by watching them in action. Their tactics, how they handle weapons, how they move. It's all important and essential if you want to stay one of us "living people". If not, you could just join the zombie hoard by walking to their abode, or chilling outside while a psy emission is raging. I wouldn't recommend any of these things, but it's your call.</text>

		<text>The scientists are good folk, they are timid like rabbits. They wouldn't breathe into a flower directly, let along kill someone. I salute them, being here in such harsh conditions, while staying so dedicated to their cause. It's hard going on each day, knowing that your bunker could be overwhelmed by the scum of the Zone, and you couldn't do much. I'd rather have basic knowledge of gun handling, but these are educated people, people with a cause. I'm here because I need to sell artifacts. It helps with my terrible habit of collecting money. I've been doing that all of my life, spending as little as possible, and I still ended up here. I seem to be saving in all the wrong ways I guess. Develop some form of economy system. Buy optimal amounts of food, spend the least amount of ammo, just the right amount necessary for the job. Doing this, you'd have much better chances not ending up like me. But I'm a dreamer, a dreamer that collects money.</text>

		<text>One thing I had to take from the outside. I know you aren't supposed to take anything here if you want to bring it back, because of all the radiation. But this was quite precious. It was a duckling. The cutest little yellow thing. Quacking like crazy all the time. I wanted to keep it inside, so it doesn't attract attention. I had a plan how to feed it and everything. It slept near my heart, where it was the warmest. I had it for 20 days, and when I came to the Zone, it didn't even survive a few hours. Normal animals don't last long here. Just those crows, and I'm not even sure they are normal at all. I've seen them scream like machines, and gouge eyes off of pseudogiants. They are vicious thieves too. If you have some trinkets, golden whatever, they will take it if stashed somewhere where they could reach it. One time a crow was shot out from the sky by this very very imprecise drunk shotgunner. It fell down, and it was holding this golden watch in it's beak. It reminded me of the duckling I had with me. I've seen my friends die painfully in the mud here, but thinking about that duckling just ravages my heart.</text>

		<text>Nobody cares about us down here. It's like we don't even exist. The first few days we were in the spotlight. Stalkers, the Zone. Afterwards they started ignoring everything that comes out of this place. Mutants, artifacts, they all think it's some kind of a hoax. Sometimes I even wonder if these artifacts give off any beneficial effects. I mean how could we know? I know the scientists are working their magic back in the bunkers, but how do I know that a specific artifact is good for this, and not for another thing? It might just be old wives tales, superstitious people making stuff up, so they could feel safer in this wasteland. That's probably not an option since even a slight level of superstition here, gets you killed. I don't know, really, it's a bit too much for me. I know I believe in a loaded gun, and a sharp knife. That's my God right there, cocked and ready to go. I pray to that God by cleaning it and doing basic maintenance, and it's very rewarding. Especially when it doesn't get stuck and does exactly what it is made for.</text>

		<text>I want to score big, just once. I've been here for a while now, why would I get lucky? I follow the right people, carry the right equipment, but it's always either a shitty Flesh, or if I'm extremely lucky, a boar. They are not profitable, to say the least. I spend 4 shots getting a boar down, and at most, I make 3 and a half shots back when I sell the stuff I take from it. Fleshes are not worth while, they barely sell well. You'd better chunk the meat and hunt for some bigger game. I heard that this one guy startled a pack of Snorks. He chucked a grenade at them while running away. He wasn't even looking back to see what happened, he just noticed that after the noise from the explosion died down, and the whistling in his ear lowered, he didn't hear the Snorks anymore. Now that's what I call scoring big. He took their feet and hands back to base, sold them at an excellent price. He went home with that money. Lucky bastard. If I waste a grenade at my boars, I would cut my own hand and sell it to the first trader that believes it's a Snork's hand.</text>

	<string id="dm_tips_62">
		<text>Carrying a lot of equipment on you has it's toll. Exoskeletons are really cool, I know. But try running away from a pack of dogs with that thing. It will drain you like a leech. There was some talk about boosters that enable you to run, but you still drain fast. I would go for light armor if I was you. You have more options that way, and the best tactic here is actually not getting shot at all. No armor repairs, no pain, no medicine. It's safe and secure. Although it's a rarity for people to go on for a while managing this, it is quite rewarding when successful. You always have the choice to either pack armor attachments like Kevlar, or put some hydration upgrades that make life much easier.</text>

		<text>Every time I see you around, I think to myself: "Now that is a guy who knows where he is going". I just loop around in circles, doing the exact same things each day. Getting bitten by Tushkano is not even exciting anymore. It's as if life has lost any meaning for me. It's bereft of any essence, and I feel I've done my share of living. It's easy getting lost here, ending up in an anomaly. Quick and painless. I've always wanted to end up with a death like that. My father was tortured before those bandits tore his throat out along with major arteries. I learned very quickly what happens to a person with torn arteries. That was my first sign that this is just a miserable game we are playing. Murdering our own kind is just too much for me. I couldn't even manage to retaliate, kill off a few bandits. I had names and whereabouts of each and every one of those bastards that did that to my father. But what is the point? We will all perish soon enough, I'd rather go immediately, than what my father went through.</text>

		<text>Once I get my hands on a good sniper, I'm off to better places. I might even visit some zombie nests. With a sniper, I could fix each and every one of those Z's, without taking a single hit. But they don't come cheap, that bastard Owl sells it for a hand and a leg. I need my hand for sniping, and my legs are very important for running around as you might already be aware. Maybe that Haitian fella has some good deals. I never trust people that are all smiling and nice to me. There is always a catch behind those smiling mouths. I'm good with a sniper too, I used to train with the army. Not in the army, but with it, along with the army. It was an awkward situation, but I was better than some army grunts at sniping. Should've come here with more money, but it's hard to get anything outside, and harder inside. I do what I have to, and right now, I have to get me a sniper.</text>

		<text>One more and I'm done. This is the last one I'm doing, and I've done a whole bunch. I used to bring in simple artifacts and pseudo artifacts. They weren't worth much, just enough to keep my belly filled with nasty shit that is edible. After I got my advanced detector, I got more expensive shit in. Beard knew my name, I was popular at Yanov. It isn't easy artifact hunting. You get burned, electrocuted and crushed. But it's gratifying. At least I don't have to put bullets in peoples heads for a living. Not a nice job that one. I had to do it once because some bandits tried to rob me while they were high as fuck on coke. All jittery and such, I had to put them down as fast as possible. Sold their coke too. I felt like a scumbag and a lowlife, but it had to be done. Now I know what routes the bandits have, and I try to not have face to face conversations with them. They don't seem to mind, or even notice me at all. I feel that is a perfect arrangement. But all that is in the past now, because this is my last run, and I'm going back to see my sweet sweet beasts. I have two Huskies, one is a big fucker, and the other has some coughing issues that I think science would never understand. Unless I pay them with artifacts. That would wake the veterinarians up I suppose.</text>

		<text>Do you know what Perpetuum Mobile is? Of course you don't. I'm going to tell you now, and you better write this shit down. A scientist I used to know was researching the peculiar phenomena of lights being able to work after years being left without a power source, without maintenance, lift's too. It's like they were feeding on some source of energy, but it couldn't be determined what that was. They theorized that those objects had become stuck in the particular time when the Zone expanded. They didn't even seem to age at all. Naturally the military would want dibs on this technology, them and every company in the world. But these objects that could work seemingly indefinitely, just died when disconnected or taken outside the Zone. They were classified as proto-artifacts and for a while, they were deemed uninteresting to science. How aloof of them. Claiming anything in here uninteresting. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_67">
		<text>Independent scientist groups started popping up around the Zone lately. Folks that don't care for the strict regulations of the military, they even might be corporate scientists. Anyway, what they found was that the proto-artifact story was half right. What they found was that the Zone itself was saturated with magnetic fields of a very complex nature. Some electrical devices started charging themselves up without a plug, just by being in the Zone, and sometimes they overcharged, burning up in the process. Tesla worked on wireless energy transfer, or so they say. He would love to get his hands on any one of these artifacts. I bet Nikola Tesla would've been a good Stalker.</text>

	<string id="dm_tips_68">
		<text>You know that this is hell on earth right? I mean you've been here more than a minute I presume? This shit is awful as it is, but it's even worse because it's like we are in the fucking stone age. Have you seen a functioning truck, hauling products? Have you seen a robot going into anomalies, fishing out artifacts while this quasi-Stalker pushes buttons from a safe distance? You haven't seen that, I know you haven't because I've never seen that myself. It just doesn't exist. Complex circuits fry up immediately here, and only smaller devices could be isolated from the harsh influence of the Zone. All the PDA's here have some form of magnetic shielding or barriers to resist the erosive magnetic forces. Simple mechanism fare much better here, but they too wear out much faster. Have you noticed how often you have to clean your shooter here? It's like any complex mechanism is a magnet for dust particles. Everything breaks down faster here, and the more complex it is, the quicker it becomes useless. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_69">
		<text>Every single device made to suck up the magnetic waves the Zone emits on a daily basis, fries up before anyone could do any solid measurements. You can't tame the Zone, you can't trick it into feeding you. Large scale engineering projects haven't been attempted because of that. It's like this place has it's own mind, and it does whatever it wants. And "it" certainly doesn't want to help us. If it did, it would make those controlers look like naked women. They would be far more efficient that way.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_70">
		<text>Have you tried contacting the outside from here? Mobile phones used to fry in peoples hands as they tried reaching someone outside. The Zone wants to keep it's secrets I guess. 3G, GPS, Radio waves, all get scrambled when directed from inside out, or the other way round. Even cables for fucks sake, they fry up too. It doesn't make any sense. Powerful military grade radios manage to maintain contact for only a few moments before they fry up. This place is a quiet desert, and it's bound to stay like that.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_71">
		<text>During the noosphere rupture a while ago, when the Zone became the Zone, something quite strange happened to some electrical circuitry. For reasons unknown to science, resistance of some circuits has been reduced to almost 1,5 µO·m which is a range normally only present in the most powerfull superconductors, those that are superchilled. This has made those circuits work parctically for years without any applied voltage as electrons are moving thru them in endless loops without lossing almost any energy. As a result, some circuits became self-sustaining, and perfectly preserved over the years, being able to propell whatever equipment was plugged into them at the moment of this massive emission. On the other hand, some circuits were completely blown out, and new circuits sometimes don't even work at all in here. This poses a problem for Scientists, especially since they have to magnetically seal their complex mechanisms, which takes a lot of effort, time and is quite costly. If this wasn't the case, I bet you'd be seeing a lot more scientists than Stalkers around the Zone.</text>

	<string id="dm_tips_72">
		<text>What you never want to happen here, is to fall unconscious, or immobile. Then you are fucked. No Stalker, good guy or bad, would ever help you out, if you can't help yourself. Each time a bullet grazes you, or hits your barely bulletproof vest, that bitch hurts, like a motherfucker. Each painful, unpleasant or fucked up thing that happens to you, takes away from your will to continue moving. Your will to survive and resist the Zone's crushing power. A few more hits and you'd be struggling to stay conscious from the pain. Do not let that happen. That's when things end for you. There was this brand new wannabe Stalker, this newbie that just came out of the box, still shining with enthusiasm and energy, he thought if he invested in a good vest, some bullet proof plates, he'd be unstoppable. He died somewhere after he ate a few bullets with his chest plate. The pain was too much for him. He threw up his insides, and probably dehydrated right there. They found his flesh ripped apart by hungry doggies or something uglier. I don't want to tell the story of how they found your body, all right?</text>

	<string id="dm_tips_73">
		<text>The human body is a very reliable machine. It can function flawlessly for decades, and it's one of the most complex systems in the known world. The Zone is a little bit different. Immune systems don't work as well, coughs last longer, cancer is obviously rampant. It's as if you are immediately drained once you step inside the Zone. To be able to work and function well inside, you need a very strong spirit, either in alcoholic form, or psychologically, preferably both. Some cowards won't stand one bite of those dogs, others can go through a pack of biting teeth and scratching claws. What is different is spirit, and sometimes drugs, but mostly spirit. You need to have strong and defined goals around here, to keep you going through the every day shit you see or survive. That is the difference between Newbies, Zone men and real Stalkers. Anyone can waltz in here, strutting shiny new weapons and cement armor, but when the going gets awful, some folk break much easier than others, and it doesn't have anything to do with the weapons you have, or the armor you are wearing. They do help, but what drives you inside, is what determines if you live or die.</text>

		<text>We are a living through an experiment here. We are the fools that are completely fine getting electrocuted, poisoned, irradiated and cut, on a regular basis, just because a bit further down the road, there is this phantom waving an appealing artifact. It's obsessive compulsive man, Stalkers have died going for artifacts that are simply out of reach. Have you seen those bodies piled up in that fireball anomaly deep inside the crack in the earth? The artifacts are the fodder, and we are the lab rats, being studied by someone. Fuck that someone man. I'd cut his jugular artery if I knew who he was or maybe he's a she. All the better, I'd cut her too.</text>

		<text>Listen, you seem new and don't have a grasp on the rank structure here. I'm going to enlighten you, so pay attention. The grunts of the force are our privates and our sergeants. A sergeant enforces the policies and changes by those appointed over him and keeps the junior sergeants and privates in line. The senior privates follow through with these orders and teaches our new privates how to act. Senior sergeants and master sergeants are the brains of the operations, they've been here longer than the others and know their ways in and out. The officer structure here consists of junior lieutenants, lieutenants, senior lieutenants, and captains. Junior lieutenants are fresh out of the academy, they tend to know as much as privates and need to be looked after by their senior lieutenants. That being said, any officer is higher ranking than any enlisted member; the captains here may not have as much hands on experience as the master sergeants, but they make the calls around here.</text>

		<text>I don't have a lot of information regarding the situation here. But remember, keep your eyes trained on everything at all times! Situational awareness, I'm sure they spouted that crap at you all during basic training. The situation here is real, we need to never lose focus of what's going on around us or else we could end up dead at any given moment. We're trapped in here with psychopaths, murders, killers, mercenaries, money-grubbers, and a fake military spin off to boot. Trust in your chain of command and always keep lines of communication between you and your superiors open. That's all I really have for information.</text>

		<text>Contrary to popular belief between the privates, we really don't have a strong foothold here even around the cordon. These people just keep trying their luck in sneaking in and making a quick buck; they're all about the riches. If you ever find yourself in a bad situation and looking down the barrel of someone elses gun, entice them with a little cash incentive. The zone is a pretty harsh place, but with a little cash and a pretty trinket or two I believe it's like any other deployed location. We go through our 12 to 16 hour shift waiting for something to happen and when it doesn't we return to our bunk, watch some shitty porn and have a wank and then go straight to bed, piece of cake.

I can't really keep on track with the time... Before shit got real with that hard-ass mercenary, our base used to brim with life with Cold flinging dirty jokes at all directions and Grey fixing up even the most broken stuff, but where did they go now, I have no idea... I don't know about Cold, but rumors are that Grey found a job as a technician for the Ecologists' bunker in Yanov... it's all eerily quiet without them now, even if we opened up our base for guests outside of our faction, I mean...
