<!-- ANOMALIES -->
	<string id="dm_anomalies_general_1">
		<text>What do you know about anomalies or artefacts?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_general_2">
		<text>You know anything about anomalies or artefacts?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_general_3">
		<text>What can you tell me about anomalies or artefacts?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_0">
		<text>I don't feel comfortable telling you anything.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_1">
		<text>Well, the Burner anomaly can be a bit difficult to see, even during daylight you can only see a faint haze. If you piss it off with one of your bolts it'll shoot out a tall pillar of flame in the air, so don't stand too close.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_2">
		<text>Comet anomalies are a lot like the Burner, both fire-y, only this is a big floating ball of flame, flying about wherever you found it. Best to duck and dive about when near those things otherwise you'll get your ass burnt off.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_3">
		<text>Vortex's are some sorta floating thing, it'll drag everything nearby towards it and start spinning it around. If you get caught up in that you'll get splattered all over the place.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_4">
		<text>Springboards are these floating gravity balls, but you touch them and whoosh, it'll blow up right in your face. You'll find everywhere and you'll probably hear them humming to you before you see them.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_5">
		<text>You should keep an eye out for Whirlgigs, dirt and leaves blowing about is a pretty good sign there's one nearby. I saw a flesh get pulled in to one when I was at the Cordon, started spinning around till is just tore itself apart from the force.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_6">
		<text>The Fruit Punch is a glowing puddle of green shit on the floor which'll hiss and spit at you. Might be able to get a good artefact from it if you're brave enough to get up next to it, but it'll melt your face off if you get a little too comfy.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_7">
		<text>Burnt Fuzz anomalies are usually found outdoors, they look like moss or vines, hanging down like curtains. Shoots these spores in your face if you run up and touch it, like some kinda defence mechanism.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_8">
		<text>Look out for green Gas anomalies floating and wandering over the ground. It's acidic and if you end up taking a stroll into the stuff it'll start trying to eat away at your legs.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_9">
		<text>Keep your eyes pealed for Gas Cloud anomalies, if you see a flying ball of acid darting around, go around or under that thing or you'll wind up looking like a flesh.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_10">
		<text>You ever see those giant electrical puddles on the ground? Electros are what the scientists call them. Most of them will only go off if something goes over and introduces itself, but half the time I swear they explode when there's nothing even there. Some of them seem to disappear for a few seconds too, if you can time it right then you can walk right past them no problem.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_11">
		<text>Few days ago I came across this floating ball of electricity, I think the eggheads named them after that electricity guy, Tesla or whatever his name was. Anyway, I was in this hallway and it was pacing up and down - no - flying up and down. Had to time it right and go bit by bit through the room, hiding behind old junk and let it keep passing me.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_12">
		<text>You know that Forester guy over in the Red Forest says he got stuck in one of those Space anomalies? Said it was like an open field of grass, endless with no way out. That was until he found a Compass artefact which showed him the exit, just like the rumours say they do. He says he got mugged by a bunch of renegades not long after and lost it, but personally I think the old coot's just going senile.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_13">
		<text>Few years ago Clear Sky went after a stalker headed for the power plant, we all know how that ended, but there was this merc with them, Scar. The few of the people that survived the mess say these anomalies started showing up all over the place that let him teleport closer to the guy he was after, like the Zone was helping him. Weird shit.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_14">
		<text>Ever seen any jagged rocks sticking out from the ground with a bunch of warped trees nearby? Me neither. But I've heard there's something like that over in the Red Forest. Apparently those Symbiont anomalies are pretty good for artefacts, you can get all kinds of stuff outta them.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_15">
		<text>Ecologists are scratching their heads over those Fault anomalies. They're these cracks, huge fractures in the ground, usually have a whole bunch of Comets and other anomalies underneath them. They've no idea if they're just anomaly fields or if there's something else to them. When was the last time you've heard of an earthquake in this part of the world?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_16">
		<text>You don't always have to crawl through anomalies to find artefacts. Someone told me a story of how they found an artefact in an open field. A stalker's detector starts going crazy, so he figures it has a blown capacitor. He replaces it and it starts working; lo and behold, an artifact practically falls into his hands.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_17">
		<text>Watch out for Whirligig and Vortex anomalies, man. Absolutely dangerous, even for an experienced stalker. It will snatch you up and violently shake you around like a rag doll. One time I saw this dude get caught up in one. I thought I would be getting me a new pair of boots, but this sucker started running as fast as he could. I couldn't believe this shit, he dove right outta there before he was shredded.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_18">
		<text>Ever heard of a Gravi? Looks like something a pseudodog would shit out, but it's metallic. Scientists are willing to pay well for these things. I wouldn't bother though, anyone who touches one of those will be glowing for a month. There are similar artefacts called Goldfish, I'm sure you can guess what it looks like, it's even more rare. Better keep it to yourself if you find one, though.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_19">
		<text>The first thing you should try to get your hands on is at least a Medusa. The more radiation absorbing an artefact you can get, like a Wrenched or a Bubble, the safer you will be. I've already seen too many stalkers slowly dying of radiation, without being able to reach a medic or even too poor to buy some antirads.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_20">
		<text>I can't figure out what the scientists make from the artefacts they buy from the Zone. All I know is crash for these seems to be limitless. And whatever if the thing is positive or not, the more powerful an artefact is, the more they pay.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_21">
		<text>Have you ever heard of the Glass? It looks like a dirty and yet shiny glass ball. Man, this thing could stop bleeding from the worst wounds if you have something to cure its radiation. Don't sell it if you find one.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_22">
		<text>I have several times heard of something called the Compass. It would appear that this artefact would be almost perfect, apart from the radiation it emits. It was rumoured that it protects against many of the risks of the Zone, but even more, it would seem that the wearer naturally find some paths through the worst anomaly fields.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_23">
		<text>What more can I tell you other than the stories everybody hears here, around a campfire? If you want advice, just take care about everything.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_24">
		<text>I often heard stories about some untouched, wonderful artefact fields that could make a poor, inexperienced stalker a rich man. My opinion is that all of these are traps. How can anyone logically think about getting into such anomaly mazes, just out of greed? Especially knowing that the anomalies can move and so, close an exit... If you think about it, the little shiny things that attract you in are perfect in their roles.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_25">
		<text>All I can say is to be really careful about the gear you choose and why. Don't expect to go for an artefact hunt with a heavy shielded exo. It can become like a pin with electric fields and will melt on you like hot chocolate in chemical ones.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_26">
		<text>The hardest thing about artefact hunting is starting. If you can grab a protective artefact, you can then explore other anomalies of the same type easily. Then sell your findings, get better gear, and so on. Plus, the more you cross them the more you will know how to do it. Just be really careful, from your beginner's hours to an experienced stalker if you come to be one, the Zone always keep new traps.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_27">
		<text>Be in good shape, that's the clever advice I can give to you. The Zone can be really harsh and exhaustive sometimes. You'll have better chances in surviving long trips and their inevitable hazards if your body is ready for it. It's true about anomalies too, do you think you can cross a chemical field with a pack of mutants at your back, after a night of vodka abuse?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_28">
		<text>Many stalkers, even more those regularly using vodka, don't pay attention to the psychic dangers of the Zone. And so, they die when they have to get out of a psi-field. It's a good thing to find some psi-protection, the Moonlight artefact can make the difference in decisive moments. Plus, it can be useful against a Controller, for instance.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_29">
		<text>Keep in mind that some people here don't bother to chase the artefacts. They prefer to hunt humans... In other words, pay a attention to the bandits. It's well known they have orders for artefacts for their black market. Don't let too many people know what artefacts you have, either.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_30">
		<text>Did you know that artefacts are almost indestructible? Sometimes it's better to shoot at the artefact to make it jump out of the anomaly, instead of just being sucked directly into it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_31">
		<text>I wish I had known the Zone that I've heard about, the one that was like a no man's land. How can we be rich now? Now that after any emission, a bunch of stalker rush on every anomaly field to pick up their flowers.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_32">
		<text>Why should I give you any advice? More so when it come to the business which many of us use for making money? Well, get a good detector and help yourself. The scientists will probably see you what you're looking for.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_33">
		<text>Many newcomers fantasize about "the artefact that makes you rich". Don't do this, even if the Zone can be fruitful, it often take a long time and a serious amount of money to get the gear that lets you go inside the most dangerous and then productive areas. Of course, you can be lucky but, knowing this place I wouldn't count this much on that.</text>
	</string>

<!-- INFORMATION -->
	<string id="dm_information_general_1">
		<text>What's new in the Zone?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_general_2">
		<text>You know what's going on around here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_general_3">
		<text>I'm looking for information.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_0">
		<text>I don't have any information.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_1">
		<text>The army set up a base in Agroprom, right in the middle of it. Place is packed with dogs and other mutants just running around with nothing stopping them. By itself, it ain't so special, but there's this huge subterranean underground full of anomalies sitting right below it. If it weren't for the soldiers I'd be down there right now hauling a whole bunch of artefacts.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_2">
		<text>The Agroprom Underground is sat underneath the research institute buildings. I hear different things about it all the time, one day I hear it's full of anomalies, perfect for artefact hunting, next it's barren, nothing but mutants, next I hear the place is full of controllers and poltergeists. Me? I don't know what to believe, damned if I'll be going down there with all the jarheads patrolling aboveground though.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_3">
		<text>You ever been to Bar? You've got the 100 Rads and the arena just across the street from each other to keep you busy. A real shining star in the middle of the Earth's asshole don't you think? Whole place used to be a giant factory complex so Duty found it perfect to set up their base of operations there. I'm not complaining though, they do a good job of keeping all the filth out, you won't see any bandits or mutants about the place.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_4">
		<text>The Cordon is quieter than most other areas. Most stay at the Rookie village north of the actual military cordon until they have enough gear and experience to head deeper into the Zone. You'll find Nimble and Sidorovich there too, Nimble'll help you get hold of really high-end gear, best of the best, while Sid sits down in his bunker where he'll sell you smuggled in goods; food, medical supplies, you get the idea.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_5">
		<text>Darkscape connects the southern edge of Dark Valley with the tunnel in the east of the Cordon. Full of forest, mutants, bandits and anomalies, but somehow you'll always find a group of loners down there for whatever reason. I wouldn't stick too close to the road either, you'll leave glowing from the radiation or you'll get torn apart by a pack of dogs.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_6">
		<text>Dark Valley is a forbidding place, filled with rusting wrecks and crumbling buildings. There's a few anomalies nearby where you can try your luck artefact hunting, but the bandits occupy the factory in the north, so good luck not getting mugged afterwards.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_7">
		<text>The Dead City is right between Yantar and Limansk with a whole gathering of mercs right in the middle. There's gotta be a huge stash of guns and meds in there somewhere, where else must they keep all their shit? If you wanna get through the place without getting your ass beat I heard you could sneak about through the sewers. Not much else I can tell you, bro.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_8">
		<text>You know they dumped all their ruined machines and vehicles after the disaster in Garbage right? Loners and bandits are always trying to get the best loot, shooting at each other all the time while trying not to get ate by the mutants. There's a whole grouping of anomalies in the little vehicle graveyard too, you're almost guaranteed an artefact if you get there right after an emission hits.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_9">
		<text>Ever been to the Generators? They're found up north beyond the power plant, six of them in a ring formation with the old war lab not far south. Not much to look at besides a few old labs, but plenty of mutants to keep your gun busy while you're there if that's your thing.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_10">
		<text>We occupy nearly all of the Deserted Hospital, most of the paths through that lead further towards the Chernobyl NPP are fenced off by a machine gun emplacements or some other shit. No stalkers will be getting through there any time soon.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_11">
		<text>Jupiter is still unsettled - much like Zaton, and since they turned on the Brain Scorcher it's almost impossible to get to there without putting your neck on the line. If you don't wanna get your brains scrambled then your only path is through the Red Forest, not that you'll make it through alive with mutants and anomalies hiding behind all the trees.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_12">
		<text>Thinking of travelling through the Jupiter Underground? You'll need a suit with a closed cycle respiratory module due to the harsh conditions within, but it'll let you go right beneath Pripyat Plaza directly to the Pripyat Outskirts so you can avoid all the cultists.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_13">
		<text>Limansk is an empty place, full of derelict buildings and vehicles. I heard the mercs tried to push through it from the Dead City recently but didn't make it that far, lost too many men to the anomalies and mutants.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_14">
		<text>The Swamps are mostly a wet and irradiated hole in the ground but you'll find a few abandoned buildings and settlements here and there which are worth looting. There's also the Clear Sky base somewhere towards the south, quite an isolated place.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_15">
		<text>Ever heard about the Army Warehouses? Freedom set up their headquarters there after they got their ass handed to them by bandits a couple years back, claim they're protecting the Zone by defending the barrier there which leads to Radar. Complete nonsense if you ask me, if the bandits could tear 'em a new one you can be sure the Monolith would have already.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_16">
		<text>The Monolith are hold up in Pripyat Plaza from what I've heard. No way of getting through all of the anomalies and mutants with them shooting at you the whole time.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_17">
		<text>You should consider checking out the Pripyat Outskirts, plenty of anomalies to make you rich and you won't even have to go through the plaza to get there either. Just take the underground passage through Jupiter, no need to worry about the Monolith down there.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_18">
		<text>Those bastards turned the Brain Scorcher back on when they took Radar, there's no way to the other side of the Zone now unless you feel like being fed to the local wildlife or being turned into one of those zombies like the ones you see in Yantar.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_19">
		<text>More and more stalkers have gotten themselves killed trying to get through the Red Forest since the takeover of Radar. The Forester can only do so much with their equipment to help, and I don't feel like sticking my balls in the frying pan for the sake of a few artefacts.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_20">
		<text>The Wild Territory used to be the site of a rather large manufacturing plant, but now the place is swarming with monsters and is full of anomalies. Only real reason to go through there is if you want to get to Bar or if you're desperate for loot, but there's plenty of other safe routes to use instead.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_21">
		<text>What would you wish for? What's the one thing you really want? If you help me find the Wish Granter then maybe it will come true. I've heard it's buried under the power plant somewhere, do you think that maybe that's what the Monolith are fighting to protect?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_22">
		<text>Yantar is morbid and sodden with death. Anyone who dares to go too far goes insane. Zombies and snorks are all over the place just waiting to introduce themselves to you. They keep spewing out of that factory, half of the time when the Ecologists gun them down they realise it's one of their own men who was shooting at them. It's real fucked.</text>
	</string>

		<text>Hey stalker, if you're ever up in Zaton you should check out the Skadovsk, it's this old rusty ship run by this stalker calling himself Beard, or at least so he likes to think he does. You can find somewhere to sleep, repair your gear and sell all your loot. Owl's always interested in buying those extra PDAs off of your hands if they have any nice info on them.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_24">
		<text>Hey, listen, have you caught word of a guy called Black Digger? I heard that he used to be a really lucky fella, got himself a nice amount of rubles and a plethora of nice items as well. Some say that he had a secret stash of his own hidden deep among piles of junk and other crap. I'd really like to find him some day and beat the info out of him, but it seems like his secret went together with him to the grave.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_25">
		<text>It probably won't be long until you or I will be tasked with information recovery deep down in some derelict laboratory. X-18 is manageable, X-16 is tougher on your psyche and has more humanoids to fill with an extra hole or two.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_26">
		<text>If you have a job that requires you to to get to either Jupiter or the eastern part of Pripyat and its outskirts, use the Underpass to make it past the Pripyat Plaza undetected - you won't have to deal with the fanatics aboveground. You'll most likely have to deal with just mutants and Zombies - I met several almost a month ago - but they don't come back after an hour passes so you can safely use it to get back to the place which you first entered from.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_27">
		<text>Be wary of machine gun nests scattered around certain strongholds and strategical locations. The gunner obviously can't hit you when you're facing his back so sneaking up to him is a valid strategy as long as you don't screw up and make yourself known to everyone around him. Usually everyone will be in enough of a panic to not take over the fallen gunner's position. Don't forget about grenades as well, a well placed throw can be enough to take one out if you're in a pinch and can't move out of cover.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_28">
		<text>If you feel like taking a long stroll, or taking out an outpost on your way to the bandit base in Dark Valley, then I suggest turning east in the Cordon and going that way until you reach Darkscape. Sometimes a squad or two may also be on patrol there, but watch out for the mutants anyway. It's a relatively quiet place but those mutant shits don't care where to breed. As for the outpost I mentioned earlier, it is located approximately in the middle, right where the road curves.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_29">
		<text>Looking for some info, eh? I can tell you that as long as you remain under our protection the mercenaries will not lay a finger on you. We are not worthy enough of being the target of their contractors because the previous leaders have been taken out, they've perished, vanished, kissed their life goodbye, whatever you want to call it. No one is looking to step up to take leadership again, besides, we'd bitch too much about this and that being wrong. The only person so far who is keeping a watch over a small area is Sultan, but his hand obviously doesn't extend far enough to reach every bandit across the entire Zone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_30">
		<text>Are you feeling like taking someone's ripe life? The loners have always been a prime choice for that. We've been pissing them off since the dawn of time and those jackasses have always deserved to be messed around with. Most aren't armed with great weaponry but they do hate us enough to put up a nice fight, so you can get both decent equipment and combat practice from them.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_31">
		<text>Hey, have you ever seen an orange midget making his way through dense reeds? I sure have, and those garbage bags stand out so well that you can spot an ecologist a mile away without even needing to use your binoculars. Recently I've noticed that they've been using colour variations that look less like the vomit inducing rubbish those scientists usually get issued.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_32">
		<text>The only thing that has less brains in its head than those darned loners are the members of the Monolith faction. It's amusing to hear tales about them and their actions, they seem like the Zone's version of retards who can think about only one thing and nothing else. Too bad that their idiocy makes them fear death less.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_33">
		<text>Man, I remember tales about how long ago some guys sporting a scorpion on their patches kicked the shit out of some boys in blue pyjamas. Everyone here always jokes about them and their clothing because they were weaker than a blind baby bloodsucker crawling in its nest. Oh, wait, now that I remember it that does make sense, all the eggheads were bad at holding a gun in their hands. They just don't know how to live off from what the Zone gives them.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_34">
		<text>If only you knew what I'd give for a mutant wave large enough to overrun the Bar. Every single time when we try to get near it we get kicked out of it by those black and red fools. They've settled in there real well, even managed to set up a pair of PKMs to ward off intruders like us. They're armed pretty well, but their command structure... He-he, they're not the purest out of all in the Zone, plenty of secret deals between us and Duty, but now they want everyone to keep their mouths shut and they don't want to see our mugs close to theirs. God knows when they'll stop throwing a tantrum about their scarred pride.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_35">
		<text>Freedom used to boast about their strength and "freedom in the Zone". We showed them just what freedom can do out here and they had to move their sorry asses far away from us. Nowadays they'll want you to think otherwise and that they switched bases because it's "safer from the mutants" or that "we can perform our duty of keeping the invaders at bay more easily". Remember, pal, it's all bullshit, they just don't want to admit that we struck fear deep into their ranks.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_36">
		<text>The army boys don't show up as much as they used to back in the day. Word has spread that their operations have went down the gutter. I definitely wouldn't feel pleased to be commanded by some asshole who just wants me to rip a mutant pack or a stalker group apart for only his own benefit. They have it tough, sure, but it looks like their failures have actually managed to knock some sense into their skulls.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_37">
		<text>The advent of artefacts and their in-depth studying sometimes leaves me wondering how much worse things can get. These things possess untold properties, some so devastating that their incorporation into weapons could surpass anything made so far. Just imagine what a bomb built upon the harnessed energy of various kinds of artefacts could do!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_38">
		<text>I find it ironic how Freedom is the faction that keeps talking about the need to let everyone make use of the Zone, yet Duty are the ones who come to Yantar to protect us and give artefacts to our leading scientists in order to help them with finding new ways to extinguish the Zone's life.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_39">
		<text>The bandits keep taking hostages to extort money and various valuables, they don't care about honesty and keeping their word, not to forget about the fact that they act like idiots and the lowest forms of life. They have it better when someone smarter comes along, although they've been keeping low for a while now and no dedicated leader has stepped up yet to take control of every bandit establishment around the whole Zone. Right now they're mostly sticking to small and organized groups scattered about. That makes it harder to instil confusion and panic amongst them when someone important kicks the bucket.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_40">
		<text>Some places can look more foreboding than they really are. Agroprom Underground serves as an example to this because right now various parts of it are closed off and the mutants don't have a lot of places to infest. I don't suggest going there unless you either want to dump your equipment or actually try to scavenge something from all the junk that's lying around. Stashing your loot in a backpack in a hard to reach place aboveground would be a better idea anyway.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_41">
		<text>The Zone can be fascinating at times. Just watching the world below you when you're sitting atop a watchtower or another tall structure, all the life running around, the wonderful formations the anomalies create, listening to the soothing music playing over at the Bar while watching night taking over day's place... That's what I like about the Zone, it's fatal but beautiful at the same time.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_42">
		<text>If I'm still going to have to sit here and do nothing other than pellet some puny mutants with my weapon then I'm going to have to reconsider my choice of joining Duty. Every day I get pushed around to do this and that but what do I get? Barely anything. I've been here for long enough to be dispatched to far more dangerous areas but it looks like a bunch of other guys have fallen into the same hole that I have. It's almost as if the top brass doesn't want to get down to really serious things and is just sitting safely in their bases until an opportunity comes so close that it can knock them out of their chairs.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_43">
		<text>Freedom may seem like a bunch of lunatics and people who are lazily sitting on their asses but they can be pretty slick when the need to be such comes to them. They've managed to spread misinformation about us before to reduce the faith of other stalkers in Duty. Besides that, they also keep on saying how protecting the barrier is their doing and how much better it makes them than us. Don't even think about believing their bullshit, they haven't been protecting the barrier that long and they never have played a large enough role in it, until they came over to crash at the warehouses, that is. We'll get back at them for trying to create a larger figure of authority about this "defending" later.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_44">
		<text>I've seen a lot of things in the Zone during my travels here, most of it has come from the times when I wasn't a part of Duty. Hell, the military stalkers are probably the toughest you'll ever meet, bar the lunatics who keep pouring in from the north. Unlike the military forces who don't go that deep into the Zone or haven't been here long enough, they have received special training or have experienced enough themselves, they possess equipment that easily outmatches that of most. They're fierce opponents in battle, sure, but if you're enough of a hotshot you can try taking them out on your own, though I wouldn't suggest doing so even though our ties with military stalkers are far, far more loose than the ones with the regular soldiers.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_45">
		<text>I'm sick of how everyone perceives us to be just a collective of potheads gathered around to do nothing other than praising the Zone and its creations. We really do try to spread useful information that we've acquired to those that need it, we take hostile action when it's needed and when there's enough danger, unlike Duty which likes to tell everyone otherwise while they're acting like a bunch of tough kids who do nothing other than beat up pathetic bandits and weak mutants.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_46">
		<text>One of the figures that we consider to be rather important is Forester. He has a keen eye on finding various paths through the dense forest, but, alas, his old age has got the best of him and he can't help himself that much outside his safe haven any more. He provided valuable assistance to Scar, thus being able to provide help to Lebedev. Forester can still be found in the Red Forest, I believe that he'll remain there for the rest of his life until he'll wither away enough to remain as just a memory imprinted in our minds.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_47">
		<text>A couple of years ago we were led by Lebedev. Those were dog days, until a merc came along and helped us get our footing in the Swamps. But then the whole Strelok thing got out of hand. Most of Clear Sky followed Lebedev and the merc north to sort it all out. Well, you know how that went. Anyway, we keep hearing about the death trucks in the Cordon, bringing back old friends. On the rare occasion there's some signs of life, but it's like they've had a massive stroke or something.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_48">
		<text>New in the zone? Listen to yourself, you almost sound like one of those bastards out there. Information huh, ever heard of Major Kuznetsov? He was a real piece, after he replaced Major Khaletskiy for the trouble he was causing, Kuznetsov goes and does the same thing! It's always the high ranking officers that are corrupted, they get a little taste of power and control and then start trying to make extra on the side through the criminals here in the Zone! I heard he met with a terrible fate when he crossed paths with that one guy... I can't recall his name but they picked him up in Pripyat I heard because he had some real important information.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_49">
		<text>We've got more guys getting dropped in later in the month. Just waiting for the Zone to give us some quiet time, so the pilots can make it in and out. Rumour has it there's some French, Finnish and British operatives coming in this time, should be interesting.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_50">
		<text>Things may be rough out here, but it doesn't mean the research has stopped. We're managing with handmade gear, and now and again we manage to grab equipment from the Ecologists, from an old friend. You'd be surprised at what we know about anti-coagulation from Bloodsuckers, and lens repair from flesh eyes.</text>

	<string id="dm_tips_0">
		<text>I really don't have any advice to give you.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_1">
		<text>Shooting an enemy in the eye will result in an instant kill, regardless of his armour level.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_2">
		<text>The AC-96/2 has a unique two round burst firing mode. In this mode, both bullets in a burst will hit the same spot.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_3">
		<text>Double-barreled shotguns can be used to fire both barrels almost simultaneously.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_4">
		<text>Don't underestimate pistols. They provide considerable stopping power and can be very effective against poorly armoured targets.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_5">
		<text>Sniper rifles are ideal for eliminating enemies from a distance, thanks to their flatness and accuracy characteristics. They are less effective at close range.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_6">
		<text>Firing on the move is considerably less accurate than when you are standing still or crouching.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_7">
		<text>Weapons and protective suits will wear out quickly in the harsh conditions of the Zone. Worn-out weapons are less accurate and prone to misfire, while suits will not protect you as well.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_8">
		<text>Mechanics will require special equipment for certain upgrades. Returning this equipment to them will allow them to upgrade your weapons and equipment further.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_9">
		<text>Psi-storms, emissions and fallout will require you to take shelter. Standing out in the open during these events have consequences.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_10">
		<text>Butterfly mines can be used to set ambushes on other stalkers or mutants. Just make sure not to stand next to them after placement as they will explode regardless of whether you are friend or foe.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_11">
		<text>Jobs are not offered exclusively by traders and mechanics. Ordinary members of your faction may have something for you, too.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_12">
		<text>Some medical products have unique properties. For example, Hercules allows you to temporarily carry more weight, while psi-blocking drugs help you resist psi-attacks on your brain.</text>

		<text>Vodka, a cheap alternative to antirad meds, is the easiest way to reduce the effects of radiation on the body.</text>

	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_18">
		<text>Stalkers don't like it when you point your weapon at them and may ask you to hide it if they feel threatened. You should holster your weapon before you talk to them.</text>

	<string id="dm_tips_19">
		<text>Energy drinks temporarily improve your endurance recovery, which increases your potential mobility.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_20">
		<text>Low endurance can make you immobile and vulnerable to enemy attack at crucial moments.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_21">
		<text>Having a detector in one hand doesn’t stop you from using a knife, pistol or bolt with your other hand.</text>

		<text>You can toggle certain data on or off via the buttons located at the top of your PDA.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_23">
		<text>In addition to their useful effects, most artefacts are also radioactive. This can be compensated for by using artefacts that absorb radiation.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_24">
		<text>Your knife is ineffective against enemies armed with firearms. Use it in close combat or for a stealthy kill.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_25">
		<text>The weight you are carrying reduces your endurance. Excess weight will restrict your mobility, while being completely overloaded will stop you from moving altogether.</text>

		<text>A detector is the only reliable way of checking anomalous areas for artefacts.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_27">
		<text>Most artefacts will remain invisible as they move around in the anomalous area, until they are identified by your detector.</text>
	</string>

		<text>Mutants are more active at night, which explains why stalkers prefer to wait for sunlight before venturing into the Zone.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_29">
		<text>If you have suffered serious radiation exposure, use anti-radiation drugs. If you don't have any, use medkits to deal with the initial symptoms and until you make it to a medic.</text>
