<!-- ANOMALIES -->
	<string id="dm_anomalies_general_1">
		<text>What do you know about anomalies?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_general_2">
		<text>You know anything about anomalies?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_general_3">
		<text>What can you tell me about anomalies?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_0">
		<text>I don't feel comfortable telling you anything.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_1">
		<text>Well, the Burner can be a bit difficult to see, even in daylight you can only see faint haze. If you piss it off with one of your bolts it'll shoot out a tall pillar of flame in the air, so don't stand too close.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_2">
		<text>Comet anomalies are a lot like the Burner, both fire-y, only this is a big floating ball of flame, flying about wherever you found it. Best to duck and dive about when near those things otherwise you'll get your ass burnt off.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_3">
		<text>Vortex's is some sorta floating thing, it'll drag everything within towards it and start spinning it around. If you get caught up in that you'll get splattered all over the place.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_4">
		<text>Springboards are these floating gravity balls, but you touch them and whoosh it'll blow up right in your face. You'll find them all over the place, you'll probably hear them humming to you before you see them.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_5">
		<text>You should keep an eye out for Whirlgigs, dirt and leaves blowing about is a pretty good indicator. I saw a flesh get pulled in to one when I was at the Cordon, started spinning around till is just tore itself apart from the force.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_6">
		<text>The Fruit Punch is a glowing puddle of green shit on the floor which'll hiss and spit at you. Might be able to get a good artefact from it if you're brave enough to get up next to it, but it'll melt your face off if you get a little too comfy.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_7">
		<text>Burnt Fuzz anomalies are usually found outdoors, they look like moss or vines, hanging down like curtains. Shoots these spores at you if you touch it though, like some kinda defence mechanism.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_8">
		<text>Look out for green Gas anomalies floating and wandering over the ground. It's acidic and if you end up taking a stroll into the stuff it'll start trying to eat away at your legs.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_9">
		<text>Keep your eyes pealed for Gas Cloud anomalies, if you see a flying ball of acid darting around, sneak around and under that thing or you'll wind up looking like a flesh.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_10">
		<text>You ever see those giant electrical puddles on the ground? Electros are what the scientists call them. Most of them will only go off something goes over an introduces itself, but half the time I swear they explode when there's nothing even there. Some of them seem to disappear for a few seconds too, if you can time it right then you can walk right past them no problem.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_11">
		<text>Few days ago I came across this floating ball of electricity, I think the eggheads named them after that electricity guy, Tesla or whatever his name was. Anyway, I was in this hallway and it was pacing up and down - no - flying up and down, across the hallway. Had to time it right and go bit by bit through the room, hiding behind old junk in the room and let it keep passing me.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_12">
		<text>You know that Forester guy over in the Red Forest says he got stuck in one of those Space anomalies? Said it was like an open field, endless with no way out. That was until he found a Compass artefact in there which showed him the exit, just like the rumours say they do. He says he got mugged by a bunch of Renegades and lost it, but personally I think the old coot's just losing his marbles.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_13">
		<text>Few years ago Clear Sky went after a stalker headed for the power plant, we all know how that ended, but there was this merc with them, Scar. The few of the people that survived the mess say these anomalies started showing up all over the place that let him teleport closer to the guy he was after, like the Zone was helping him. Weird shit.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_14">
		<text>Ever seen any jagged rocks sticking out from the ground with a bunch of warped trees nearby? Me neither. But I've heard there's one over in the Red Forest. Apparently those Symbiont anomalies are pretty good for artefacts, you can get all kinds of stuff outta them.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_15">
		<text>Ecologists are scratching their heads over those Fault anomalies. They're these cracks, huge fractures in the ground, usually have a whole bunch of Comets and other anomalies underneath them. They've no idea if they're just anomaly fields or if there's something else to them. When was the last time you've heard of an earthquake in Ukraine?</text>

<!-- INFORMATION -->
	<string id="dm_information_general_1">
		<text>What's new in the Zone?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_general_2">
		<text>You know what's going on around here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_general_3">
		<text>I'm looking for information.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_0">
		<text>I don't have any information.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_1">
		<text>The army set up a base over in Agroprom, right in the middle of it. Place is packed with dogs and other mutants just running around with nothing stopping them. By itself, it ain't so special, but there's this huge subterranean underground full of anomalies sitting right below it. If it weren't for the soldiers I'd be down there right now hauling a whole bunch of artefacts out of it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_2">
		<text>The Agroprom Underground is sat underneath the research institute buildings. I hear different things about it all the time, one day I hear it's full of anomalies, perfect for artefact hunting, next it's barren, nothing but mutants, next I hear the place is full of controllers and poltergeists. I don't know what to believe, damned if I'll be going there with all the jarheads patrolling aboveground though.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_3">
		<text>You ever been to Bar? You've got the 100 Rads and the arena just across the street from each other to keep you busy. A real shining star in the middle of the Earth's asshole don't you think? Whole place used to be a giant factory complex so Duty found it perfect to set up their base of operations there. I'm not complaining though, they do a good job of keeping all the filth out, you won't seem any bandits or mutants about the place.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_4">
		<text>The Cordon is quieter than most other areas. Most stay at the Rookie village north of the actual military cordon outpost until they have enough gear and experience to head deeper into the Zone. You'll find Nimble and Sidorovich there too, Nimble'll help you get hold of really high-end gear, best of the best, while Sid sits down in his bunker where he'll sell you smuggled in goods; food, medical supplies, you get the idea.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_5">
		<text>Darkscape connects the southern edge of Dark Valley with the tunnel in the east of the Cordon. Full of forest, mutants, bandits and anomalies, but somehow you'll always find a group of loners down there for whatever reason. I wouldn't stick too close to the road either, you'll leave glowing from the radiation or you'll get torn apart by a pack of dogs.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_6">
		<text>Dark Valley is a forbidding place, filled with rusting wrecks and crumbling buildings. There's a few anomalies nearby where you can try your luck artefact hunting, but the bandits occupy the factory in the north, so good luck not getting mugged afterwards.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_7">
		<text>The Dead City is right between Yantar and Limansk with a whole gathering of mercs right in the middle. There's gotta be a huge stash of guns and meds in there somewhere, where else must they keep all their shit? If you wanna get through the place without getting your ass beat I heard you could sneak about through the sewers. Not much else I can tell you, bro.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_8">
		<text>You know they dumped all their ruined machines and vehicles after the disaster in Garbage right? Loners and bandits are always trying to get the best loot, shooting at each other all the time while trying not to get ate by the mutants. There's a whole grouping of anomalies in the car park too, you're almost guaranteed an artefact if you get there right after an emission hits.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_9">
		<text>Ever been to the Generators? They're found up north beyond the power plant, six of them in a ring formation with the old war lab not far south. Not much to look at besides a few old labs, but plenty of mutants to keep your gun busy while you're there if that's your thing.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_10">
		<text>We occupy nearly all of the Deserted Hospital, most of the paths through that lead further towards the Chernobyl NPP are fenced off by a machine gun emplacements or some other shit. No stalkers will be getting through there any time soon.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_11">
		<text>Jupiter is still unsettled - much like Zaton, and since they turned on the Brain Scorcher it's almost impossible to get to without putting your neck on the line. If you don't wanna get your brains scrambled then your only way in is through the Red Forest, not that you'll make it through alive with all the mutants and anomalies hiding behind all the trees.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_12">
		<text>Thinking of travelling through the Jupiter Underground? You'll need suit with a closed cycle respiratory module due to the harsh conditions within, but it'll let you go right beneath Pripyat Plaza directly to the Pripyat Outskirts, so you can avoid all the cultists.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_13">
		<text>Limansk is an empty place, full of derelict buildings and vehicles. I heard the mercs tried to push through it from the Dead City recently but didn't make it that far, lost too many to the anomalies and mutants.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_14">
		<text>The Swamps is mostly a wet and irradiated hole in the ground but you'll find a few abandoned buildings and settlements here and there which are worth looting.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_15">
		<text>Ever heard of the Army Warehouses? Freedom set up their headquarters there after they got their ass handed to them by bandits a couple years back, claim they're protecting the Zone by defending the barrier there which leads to Radar. Complete nonsense if you ask me, if the bandits could tear 'em a new one the Monolith would've more than done so by now.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_16">
		<text>The Monolith are hold up in Pripyat Plaza from what I've heard. No way of getting through all of the anomalies and mutants with them shooting at you the whole time.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_17">
		<text>You should consider checking out the Pripyat Outskirts, stalker, plenty of anomalies to make you rich, you won't even have to go through the plaza to get there either, just take the underground passed through Jupiter, no need to worry about the Monolith.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_18">
		<text>Those bastards turned the Brain Scorcher back on when they took Radar, there's no way to the other side of the Zone now unless you feel like feeding the local wildlife or being turned into one of those zombies like the ones you see in Yantar.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_19">
		<text>More and more stalkers have gotten themselves killed trying to get through the Red Forest since the Monolith took over Radar. The Forester can only do so much with your equipment to help, but I don't feel like sticking my balls in the frying pan for the sake of a few artefacts.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_20">
		<text>The Wild Territory used to be the site of a rather large manufacturing plant, but now the place is swarming with monsters and is full of anomalies. Only real reason to go through there is if you want to get to Bar, but there's plenty of other safe routes to use instead.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_21">
		<text>What would you wish for? What's the one thing you really want? hWell, help me find the Wish Granter and maybe it'll come to fruitation. I've heard it's buried under the power plant somewhere, do you think that maybe that's what the Monolith are fighting to protect?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_22">
		<text>Yantar is morbid and sodden with death. Anyone who dares to go too far goes insane. Zombies and snorks are all over the place just waiting to introduce themselves to you. They keep spewing out of that factory, half of the time when the Ecologists gun them down they realise it's one of their own men who was shooting at them. It's real fucked.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_23">
		<text>Hey stalker, if you're ever up in Zaton you should check out the Skadovsk, it's this old rusty ship run by this stalker calling himself Beard, or at least so he likes to think he does. You can find somewhere to sleep, repair your gear and sell all your loot. Owl's always interested in buying those extra PDAs off of your hands if they have any nice info on them.</text>

	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_0">
		<text>I really don't have any advice to give you.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_1">
		<text>Shooting an enemy in the eye will result in an instant kill, regardless of his armour level.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_2">
		<text>The AC-96/2 has a unique two round burst firing mode. In this mode, both bullets in a burst will hit the same spot.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_3">
		<text>Double-barreled shotguns can be used to fire both barrels almost simultaneously.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_4">
		<text>Don't underestimate pistols. They provide considerable stopping power and can be very effective against poorly armoured targets.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_5">
		<text>Sniper rifles are ideal for eliminating enemies from a distance, thanks to their flatness and accuracy characteristics. They are less effective at close range.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_6">
		<text>Firing on the move is considerably less accurate than when you are standing still or crouching.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_7">
		<text>Weapons and protective suits will wear out quickly in the harsh conditions of the Zone. Worn-out weapons are less accurate and prone to misfire, while suits will not protect you as well.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_8">
		<text>Mechanics will require special equipment for certain upgrades. Returning this equipment to them will allow them to upgrade your weapons and equipment further.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_9">
		<text>Psi-storms, emissions and fallout will require you to take shelter. Standing out in the open during these events have consequences.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_10">
		<text>Butterfly mines can be used to set ambushes on other stalkers or mutants. Just make sure not to stand next to them after placement as they will explode regardless of whether you are friend or foe.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_11">
		<text>Jobs are not offered exclusively by traders and mechanics. Ordinary members of your faction may have for you to complete.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_12">
		<text>Some medical products have unique properties. For example, Hercules allows you to temporarily carry more weight, while psi-blocking drugs help you resist psi-attacks on your brain.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_13">
		<text>Vodka, a cheap alternative to antirad meds, is the easiest way to reduce the effects of radiation on the body.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_14">
		<text>You need a detector to search for artefacts. The best detectors make searching easier and may even detect more valuable artefacts.</text>

	<string id="dm_tips_17">
		<text>You can access detailed information about the current mission through your PDA.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_18">
		<text>Stalkers don't like it when you point your weapon at them and may ask you to hide it if they feel threatened. You should holster your weapon before you talk to other stalkers.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_19">
		<text>Energy drinks temporarily improve your endurance recovery, which increases your potential mobility.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_20">
		<text>Low endurance can make you immobile and vulnerable to enemy attack at crucial moments.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_21">
		<text>Having a detector in one hand doesn’t stop you from using a knife, pistol or bolt with your other hand.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_22">
		<text>You can toggle certain data on or off via the buttons located at the top of your PDA.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_23">
		<text>In addition to their useful effects, most artefacts are also radioactive. This can be compensated for by using artefacts that absorb radiation.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_24">
		<text>Your knife is ineffective against enemies armed with firearms. Use it in close combat or for a stealthy kill.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_25">
		<text>The weight you are carrying reduces your endurance. Excess weight will restrict your mobility, while being completely overloaded will stop you from moving altogether.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_26">
		<text>A detector is the only reliable way of checking anomalous areas for artefacts.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_27">
		<text>Most artefacts will remain invisible as they move around in the anomalous area, until they are identified by your detector.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_28">
		<text>Mutants are more active at night, which explains why stalkers prefer to wait for sunlight before venturing into the Zone.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_29">
		<text>If you have suffered serious radiation exposure, use anti-radiation drugs. If you don't have any, use medkits to deal with the initial symptoms and until you make it to a medic.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_30">
		<text>Many stalkers believe that the legendary Wish Granter exists and is hidden somewhere within the Chernobyl NPP.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_31">
		<text>Selling artefacts isn’t the only way to make some cash: offloading unneeded equipment can be a profitable business, too. Keep in mind that traders aren’t usually interested in items that are seriously damaged.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_32">
		<text>If you want to move with minimal noise, you should try to sneak around by crouching.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_33">
		<text>You can attach items to your weapons, such as scopes, silencers or under-barrel grenade launchers.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_34">
		<text>Shotguns are close-combat weapons. The further your enemy is from you, the less effective they are.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_35">
		<text>When taking cover from small arms fire, make sure to hide behind something solid. Unlike concrete walls, wooden boards and sheet metal don't make for very safe cover.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_36">
		<text>Bandages should be used immediately to prevent bleeding. Whilst bleeding you will gradually lose health and will end up having to use a medkit.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_37">
		<text>Each type of mutant in the Zone has its own combat traits. If you take these into account, you will be far more likely to survive.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_38">
		<text>Enemies can and will use grenades. When you see the grenade hurled towards you, leave the kill zone immediately.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_39">
		<text>Speeding up before you jump allows you to overcome big gaps and cracks.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_40">
		<text>The Zone has a life of its own, which means that there’s always a chance of bumping into mutants or enemy stalkers in areas that you have already cleared.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_41">
		<text>Stay alert in the Zone and don’t rely on old information. When you return to an anomalous area you’ve already explored, you may find that the old tested path is no longer available.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_42">
		<text>You can hold more than one weapon at any time. This allows you to create flexible weapon combinations, such as assault rifle and shotgun, or a pistol and sniper rifle.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_43">
		<text>Every trader you encounter in various stalker camps offers his own, unique range of goods.  As an example, medics are bound to have the best selection of medical products.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_44">
		<text>If you get to a stalker camp wounded or with radiation poisoning, you can make use of assistance from the local medic.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_45">
		<text>Smash open any boxes and small metal containers you see. You may find food or medical items which you can then use or sell.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_46">
		<text>If you need to wait for a specific hour you can take a nap at the camp to pass the time.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_47">
		<text>The night vision device in your helmet can be upgraded to the next-generation version. This will expand its coverage range considerably.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_48">
		<text>When out in the Zone, keep some spare ammunition boxes on you - they’re bound to come in handy.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_49">
		<text>To use drugs appropriately it helps to know what they do. Consult drug descriptions to find out the effects of certain drugs.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_50">
		<text>Use grenades to attack enemies in cover. Keep in mind the grenade’s blast radius to avoid hurting friendly fighters.</text>
