<!-- ANOMALIES -->
	<string id="dm_anomalies_general_1">
		<text>What do you know about anomalies?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_general_2">
		<text>You know anything about anomalies?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_general_3">
		<text>What can you tell me about anomalies?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_0">
		<text>I don't feel comfortable telling you anything.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_1">
		<text>The Burner can be a bit difficult to see, even in daylight, as it's only revealed by a faint heat haze. If the anomaly is triggered by either a living being or an object such as a metal bolt, it shoots out a tall pillar of flame in the air, burning everything in its vicinity.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_2">
		<text>Comet anomalies function much like a Burner, it deals fire damage on close contact but with a key difference, the Comet is mobile, hovering around within a certain area and at a rapid pace.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_3">
		<text>The Vortex is an anomaly with a gravitational nature. When triggered, the tremendous power of the Vortex drags everything within range towards the center. Anything drawn into the core have little to no chance of survival.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_4">
		<text>Springboard anomalies are an unstable gravitational field limited to a pocket on ground level which react to the presence of creatures or objects by sending out a powerful shockwave that damages anything within a certain radius.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_5">
		<text>Whirlgigs are a common and dangerous anomaly that snatches its victims up in the air and spins them at a breakneck speed. The exact nature of the Whirligig remains unknown. It can be recognized by a light whirlwind of dust above, and by, body fragments scattered in the vicinity.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_6">
		<text>The Fruit Punch is a puddle of lambent green liquid that is easily visible in almost any environment due to its bright glow and distinctive hissing and bubbling noises. On contact with creatures or objects such as bolts, a Fruit Punch lights up brightly and emits a sharp hissing sound. It is extremely corrosive, damaging creatures and objects on contact.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_7">
		<text>Burnt Fuzz anomalies are usually found outdoors. They resembles moss or vines, hanging down like curtains from its growing spot. It reacts to rapidly approaching living beings by discharging a cloud of projectiles severely injuring uncovered or lightly protected skin upon contact.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_8">
		<text>Gas anomalies as not always easy to spot, but are recognizable by the green gas clouds floating and wandering over the ground. When triggered by metal parts or organic tissue, it emits acidic compounds, splashing them around in its vicinity.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_9">
		<text>The Gas Cloud anomaly resembles a Gas anomaly and causes chemical burns, however it moves and deals far more damage. As such, it is the chemical counterpart of the Comet and Tesla anomalies.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_10">
		<text>Electro anomalies accumulates large quantities of static electricity. When triggered, the anomaly bursts into a storm of arcing electricity nearly always lethal to all living beings. Easily recognizable by the blue gas it emits, along with the endless arcing of small bolts of electricity in the vicinity.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_11">
		<text>The Tesla anomaly functions much like an Electro anomaly and deals electrical damage, with the difference is that the Tesla is mobile. In that sense, it's the Electro's equivalent of the Comet. It takes the appearance of a fast-moving ball of pure electricity.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_12">
		<text>Space anomalies are truly the ultimate result of the Zone's instability as they alters the very fabric of reality and distorts time and space, seemingly creating miniature wormholes, which "teleport" anything thrown into it to another spot.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_13">
		<text>Teleport anomalies are a rare and found in few locations throughout the Zone. Harmless in nature, and contact causes you to teleport to another location.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_14">
		<text>Symbiont anomalies are easily recognisable from a distance by the jagged rock claws surrounding them, and the warped trees nearby. The ground within the anomaly is cracked and collapsed downwards slightly, forming several distinct rings.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_15">
		<text>Fault anomalies appears to be Burner anomaly fields, but feature large cracks on the surface of the Earth. Ambient temperatures are extremely high, especially within the cracks. A second kind exists and has a similar appearance, but features gravity-based anomalies as well.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_16">
		<text>Lift anomalies are harmless, temporarily negating normal gravity which manifests itself as an area - usually several meters in diameter - where Earth's gravitational pull is greatly reduced.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_17">
		<text>The Time anomaly is a true miracle; an area several meters in diameter where the time flow is significantly slower than usual. They appears to have no negative effect on human health. However, they can be very difficult to get out of.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_18">
		<text>Fog anomalies are a unprepossessing fog which attacks unprotected areas of the body and corrodes skin, hair, eyes, leaving a scorched corpse. Getting into fog without a protective suit or oxygen mask can lead to death.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_anomalies_19">
		<text>The Rusty Hair anomaly causes all metal surfaces nearby to gradually accumulate the so-called rusty hair, which, when touched, will cause the body to blacken, smoke and apparently rot.</text>
	</string>

<!-- INFORMATION -->
	<string id="dm_information_general_1">
		<text>What's new in the Zone?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_general_2">
		<text>You know what's going on around here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_general_3">
		<text>I'm looking for information.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_0">
		<text>I don't have any information.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_1">
		<text>Agroprom is a strange, heavily contaminated area, home to the Agroprom Research Institute and a factory, connected to the outside world via railway tracks. It's notable for it's extensive network of underground facilities, corridors and other areas. To the north-west lies a shallow lake, chocked full of abandoned equipment and other debris.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_2">
		<text>The Agroprom Underground is a collection of tunnels and rooms beneath the Agroprom Research Institute and connects to two places in that area. You'll be able to find a lot of things here, though mostly mutants and anomalies, you might get lucky and come back with plenty of artefacts.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_3">
		<text>Bar houses the 100 Rads, the Duty headquarters and the arena. Due to the heavy presence of Duty personnel, the area is almost completely secure with only a few small packs of dogs threatening the peace and quiet. Experienced stalkers often spend time here, drinking at the bar or betting on fights in the arena.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_4">
		<text>The Cordon is the outermost edge of the Zone and is quieter than most other areas. Stalkers often refer to the Cordon as the Zone's antechamber. Most rookies stay at the Rookie village north of the actual military cordon outpost until they have enough gear and experience to head deeper into the Zone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_5">
		<text>Darkscape connects the southern edge of Dark Valley with the abandoned tunnel in the Cordon. Roads lead out of the area south and east, although where they exactly lead is unknown. It is a densely forested area with few landmarks aside from at the end of the most narrow part of the valley, where there lies a collapsed train bridge, part of the railway that passes through the Cordon and the Swamps.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_6">
		<text>Dark Valley is a forbidding place, filled with rusting wrecks and crumbling buildings and was once a major agricultural research area. In addition to a farmstead and a factory in the north occupied by bandits, so naturally their presence in the area is high.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_7">
		<text>The Dead City is a old town located between Yantar and Limansk that was abandoned by its inhabitants. The city is occupied by bandits and mercenaries, who are constantly fighting it out with each other. However, a subterranean sewer system allows one to navigate under the city avoiding most contact.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_8">
		<text>Described as a "vast machinery graveyard", the Garbage was in fact the main dumping ground for ruined machines and vehicles, as well as irradiated junk after the disaster. Loners and bandits are always trying to lay claim to the best loot, most often leading to fighting and bloodshed. Notable sites within the Garbage area include an old train hangar, a fenced-in scrapyard, and a ruined office building.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_9">
		<text>Generators is a fairly large area and has a dark atmosphere, the location contains large, sphere-shaped generators which are positioned around an antenna, these are responsible for emissions because these created the rift in the noosphere for the common consciousness.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_10">
		<text>The Deserted Hospital lacks the Zone's normal irradiated areas and lands of anomalies. Nearly all of the hospital has been occupied by the Monolith, and most of the paths that lead further towards the Chernobyl NPP are fenced off by a machine gun emplacement or some other kind of fortification.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_11">
		<text>Jupiter is still relatively unsettled - much like Zaton, and since the reactivation of the Brain Scorcher access has largely been cut off for stalkers on both sides. Home to many notable landmarks such the Yanov station and Jupiter Factory, there are plenty of riches that remain undiscovered.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_12">
		<text>The Jupiter Underground can be accessed via the rail line north of the factory in Jupiter. A suit with a closed cycle respiratory module is a necessity due to the harsh conditions within. Traversing the underground allows one to go beneath Pripyat Plaza directly to the Pripyat Outskirts.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_13">
		<text>Limansk is an empty place, abandoned by its former inhabitants. The derelict buildings and vehicles that litter the city witness only the occasional bandit or Monolith patrol passing through. After the formation of the Zone, it became an even more unwelcoming place, as anomalies filled the city and its surroundings, cutting it off from the world.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_14">
		<text>The Swamps consist mostly of murky irradiated water and tall reeds, with thin passages of safe land stretching like bridges all over. A few abandoned buildings and settlements dot the landscape. To the north lies the Agroprom Research Institute, just beyond the Hunter's Woods, to the east, the Cordon, and to the west, the mysterious Tuzla tunnel.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_15">
		<text>Army Warehouses is an abandoned area, taking its name from the old military base located within its limits. It's one of the few direct access points to the center of the Zone. A strategically important area, the vicinity of the army base contains a small rural village and passageway to the radar facility north of it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_16">
		<text>Pripyat Plaza is a legend among stalkers, as it is rumoured to be full of artefacts, and to be the easiest way to the Chernobyl NPP. It is also home to the Monolith, with their headquarters located in an abandoned theatre towards the center of the city. The Pripyat Outskirts can be accessed directly towards the east.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_17">
		<text>Pripyat Outskirts is a ruined city full of anomalies, mutants and Monolith patrols. Notable landmarks include the Yubileiny Service Center, Prometheus Cinema and River Port. It can be accessed via Priyat Plaza towards the west or by traversing underneath Jupiter, via the Jupiter Underground.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_18">
		<text>Radar is a former military installation now occupied by the Monolith. The Brain Scorcher can be located at a facility within the area, and while active, travelling from the northern to southern parts of the Zone, or vice versa, are an almost insurmountable feat for most stalkers.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_19">
		<text>The Red Forest is a woodlands area north of the Army Warehouses. It takes its nickname from the first disaster which killed all the trees and turned them a bright red colour. The area is home to many dangerous mutants and anomalies as well as Forester, an old man who repairs and upgrades stalker's equipment.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_20">
		<text>The Wild Territory used to be the site of a rather large manufacturing plant, currently in ruins. Many stalkers meet their death here, as the place is swarming with monsters and is full of anomalies. However for the patient and careful, many artefacts can potentially be found. To the west lies a path which leads you to Yantar, and another to the south which takes you to the Garbage.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_21">
		<text>Following the second incident and the emergence of the Zone, the Chernobyl NPP became inaccessible. Not many stalkers have been there, and the Clear Sky faction was almost all but destroyed after a failed assault several years ago, however this has not prevented stalkers from trying to reach it. Many believe that the legendary Wish Granter can be found within reactor four's sarcophagus.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_22">
		<text>Located by a lake of the same name which dried up a long time ago, leaving a shallow swamp in its place, Yantar is morbid and sodden with death. Great danger signs await any adventurous soul foolish enough to get near it. Anyone who dares to go too far goes insane. Zombified stalkers and snorks roam in the marshes waiting to attack victims.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_information_23">
		<text>Like the Swamps, Zaton is mainly a swampy area, with a few industrial factories and derelict, grounded boats, some dating back before the incident, scattered around it. From the outlying structures and sizeable number of grounded boats and tankers, Zaton must have been drained of its water some time in the last couple decades. A bar is run by Beard, in the wreck of the Skadovsk.</text>

		<text>How do you manage to stay alive here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_general_3">
		<text>What kind of advice can you give about the Zone?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_0">
		<text>I really don't have any advice to give you.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_1">
		<text>Shooting an enemy in the eye will result in an instant kill, regardless of his armour level.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_2">
		<text>The AC-96/2 has a unique two round burst firing mode. In this mode, both bullets in a burst will hit the same spot.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_3">
		<text>Double-barreled shotguns can be used to fire both barrels almost simultaneously.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_4">
		<text>Don't underestimate pistols. They provide considerable stopping power and can be very effective against poorly armoured targets.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_5">
		<text>Sniper rifles are ideal for eliminating enemies from a distance, thanks to their flatness and accuracy characteristics. They are less effective at close range.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_6">
		<text>Firing on the move is considerably less accurate than when you are standing still or crouching.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_7">
		<text>Weapons and protective suits will wear out quickly in the harsh conditions of the Zone. Worn-out weapons are less accurate and prone to misfire, while suits will not protect you as well.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_8">
		<text>Mechanics will require special equipment for certain upgrades. Returning this equipment to them will allow them to upgrade your weapons and equipment further.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_9">
		<text>Psi-storms, emissions and fallout will require you to take shelter. Standing out in the open during these events have consequences.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_10">
		<text>Butterfly mines can be used to set ambushes on other stalkers or mutants. Just make sure not to stand next to them after placement as they will explode regardless of whether you are friend or foe.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_11">
		<text>Jobs are not offered exclusively by traders and mechanics. Ordinary members of your faction may have for you to complete.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_12">
		<text>Some medical products have unique properties. For example, Hercules allows you to temporarily carry more weight, while psi-blocking drugs help you resist psi-attacks on your brain.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_13">
		<text>Vodka, a cheap alternative to antirad meds, is the easiest way to reduce the effects of radiation on the body.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_14">
		<text>You need a detector to search for artefacts. The best detectors make searching easier and may even detect more valuable artefacts.</text>

		<text>You can locate the edges of an anomaly by throwing bolts.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_16">
		<text>As well as addressing your hunger, food will also slightly improve your health.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_17">
		<text>You can access detailed information about the current mission through your PDA.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_18">
		<text>Stalkers don't like it when you point your weapon at them and may ask you to hide it if they feel threatened. You should holster your weapon before you talk to other stalkers.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_19">
		<text>Energy drinks temporarily improve your endurance recovery, which increases your potential mobility.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_20">
		<text>Low endurance can make you immobile and vulnerable to enemy attack at crucial moments.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_21">
		<text>Having a detector in one hand doesn’t stop you from using a knife, pistol or bolt with your other hand.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_22">
		<text>You can toggle certain data on or off via the buttons located at the top of your PDA.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_23">
		<text>In addition to their useful effects, most artefacts are also radioactive. This can be compensated for by using artefacts that absorb radiation.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_24">
		<text>Your knife is ineffective against enemies armed with firearms. Use it in close combat or for a stealthy kill.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_25">
		<text>The weight you are carrying reduces your endurance. Excess weight will restrict your mobility, while being completely overloaded will stop you from moving altogether.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_26">
		<text>A detector is the only reliable way of checking anomalous areas for artefacts.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_27">
		<text>Most artefacts will remain invisible as they move around in the anomalous area, until they are identified by your detector.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_28">
		<text>Mutants are more active at night, which explains why stalkers prefer to wait for sunlight before venturing into the Zone.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_29">
		<text>If you have suffered serious radiation exposure, use anti-radiation drugs. If you don't have any, use medkits to deal with the initial symptoms and until you make it to a medic.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_30">
		<text>Many stalkers believe that the legendary Wish Granter exists and is hidden somewhere within the Chernobyl NPP.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_tips_31">
		<text>Selling artefacts isn’t the only way to make some cash: offloading unneeded equipment can be a profitable business, too. Keep in mind that traders aren’t usually interested in items that are seriously damaged.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_32">
		<text>If you want to move with minimal noise, you should try to sneak around by crouching.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_33">
		<text>You can attach items to your weapons, such as scopes, silencers or under-barrel grenade launchers.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_34">
		<text>Shotguns are close-combat weapons. The further your enemy is from you, the less effective they are.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_35">
		<text>When taking cover from small arms fire, make sure to hide behind something solid. Unlike concrete walls, wooden boards and sheet metal don't make for very safe cover.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_36">
		<text>Bandages should be used immediately to prevent bleeding. Whilst bleeding you will gradually lose health and will end up having to use a medkit.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_37">
		<text>Each type of mutant in the Zone has its own combat traits. If you take these into account, you will be far more likely to survive.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_38">
		<text>Enemies can and will use grenades. When you see the grenade hurled towards you, leave the kill zone immediately.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_39">
		<text>Speeding up before you jump allows you to overcome big gaps and cracks.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_40">
		<text>The Zone has a life of its own, which means that there’s always a chance of bumping into mutants or enemy stalkers in areas that you have already cleared.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_41">
		<text>Stay alert in the Zone and don’t rely on old information. When you return to an anomalous area you’ve already explored, you may find that the old tested path is no longer available.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_42">
		<text>You can hold more than one weapon at any time. This allows you to create flexible weapon combinations, such as assault rifle and shotgun, or a pistol and sniper rifle.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_43">
		<text>Every trader you encounter in various stalker camps offers his own, unique range of goods.  As an example, medics are bound to have the best selection of medical products.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_44">
		<text>If you get to a stalker camp wounded or with radiation poisoning, you can make use of assistance from the local medic.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_45">
		<text>Smash open any boxes and small metal containers you see. You may find food or medical items which you can then use or sell.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_46">
		<text>If you need to wait for a specific hour you can take a nap at the camp to pass the time.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_47">
		<text>The night vision device in your helmet can be upgraded to the next-generation version. This will expand its coverage range considerably.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_48">
		<text>When out in the Zone, keep some spare ammunition boxes on you - they’re bound to come in handy.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_49">
		<text>To use drugs appropriately it helps to know what they do. Consult drug descriptions to find out the effects of certain drugs.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="dm_tips_50">
		<text>Use grenades to attack enemies in cover. Keep in mind the grenade’s blast radius to avoid hurting friendly fighters.</text>
